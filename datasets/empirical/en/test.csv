TPCCHT-000157,"good morning ! do you watch baseball ? it can be a lucrative thing to be a fan of the game . a man found 3 million dollars worth of baseball cards once .
i am a baseball fan . i used to collect cards but i really doubt mine are worth 3 million dollars .
after hearing about that man i wish i had collected them . the ones he found though were from the 1900s . they had been stashed away since the 1940s .
i could only imagine how exciting that was . my cards were from the late 1980s and 1990s , there were a lot of sets made then . i bet there were a lot less made in the 1900s .
i don ' t know actually . the weird thing about baseball is that it ' s america ' s national pastime but it is super popular in japan of all places .
i know that a few countries in asia have really taken up baseball . a lot of former mlb players play in korea as well .
i ' ve heard that before . japan likes it so much that they are actually shocked to learn that it comes from america .",that surprises me because after world war 2 they have become a lot more open to western culture and adopting some of our styles and customs .
CMUDOG-003659,"Oh yes, it is! It is weird to see him as an assassin. However it is so good. The action scenes are amazing. Good soundtrack, too!
}
I know. I think the story line is really good.
Yeah, I mean when I watched it I did not have any expectations. The premise is simple, he is a retired assassin. and they killed his dog
I think that would be a very sad part of the movie since the puppy was given to him by his deceased wife.
Its a revenge thriller, and it has a lot of style going on. Exactly. Has a lot of emotion, and action at the same time
That would really make it a good movie.
Definitely. The coreography for the fight scene and the setting makes it amazing. Has a good cast
Yes. The cast is great. I think they would all work really good together.
Exactly. Do you have a favorite action movie?
I actually have several. Taken is one of my favorites. I will have to watch this one though because it sound like I would really enjoy it.",Definitely. I love the Taken series. Liam Neeson is one of my favorite actors

TPCCHT-005620,"i know why . mcdonalds want to serve soldiers who weren ' t allowed to get out of their cars when wearing fatigues . do you know when ?
i think it was a 1975 . i ' m so curious why those soldiers couldn ' t get out of their car though . i guess that rules out dated at this point , because i know that they can get out of their cars now
no doubt . i have picked up the tab of a few soldiers i have seen eating in uniform at restaurants . probably didn ' t want to overwhelm the civilians in an army town . cars became more widespread in the us faster than in europe .
oh that ' s really nice of you . do you know why the trunk of a car is called a trunk ? apparently in old cars they would put wooden trunks in the back , and that name just kind of stuck
i have seen that on restored cards from early in the last century . i wonder why they call it a boot in the uk . i live in phoenix and a google subsidiary now has a taxi like service here with autonomous cars .
oh wow that ' s cool . have you ridden in one before ? i wonder if automated cars will ever do what they do in south africa , aka put flamethrowers on top of them lol
car jackers are a real problem in south africa . i have been there and gated communities have 12 foot fences with razor wire on top . so no wonder the flame thrower are legal .
oh wow . how is that country by the way ? i only hear bad things in the news these days . and i don ' t know , i could use a flamethrower right now , i know that my driveway is full of ice lol
you may have more snow coming depending on where you live . there is real income inequality in south africa . the most expensive thing that most people own is a machine gun , not a house or a car . i walked by 40 men digging a ditch with pick - axes and they were paid $ 2 per day . did you know that rap dates back to ancient egyptians .
wow that sounds really crazy . and no i didn ' t know that , i wish we could listen to egyptian rap lol . do you ever listen to tupac shakur ? apparently some of his music is in the library of congress",i have heard tupac . muhammad ali was another early practitioner of rap like rhythm . i enjoyed him .

yeah more or less. he invents these new technology that allows him to transform. into Iron Man
that sounds pretty interesting. So there's like an Iron Man suit that he wears?
yeah, he was held captive and the only way to survive is through it
Oh, that sounds like it would be cool to watch. Are there other main characters besides the good guy and the bad guy?
once he returns home he makes the suit which is powered by the suit. the bad guy is another contractor for the army","So basically the suit helps him be

Oh, that scene is scary!
Yeah, but I love every Scream movie to be honest. Every scene is really good.
I definitely liked this one better than the first Scream.
I agree! It was a brilliant follow-up. It was great seeing the main three back again and the shocking kill was really unexpected.
So true. I wonder if it won any awards?
It did! It won the MTV Movie and TV Award 1998, Best Female Performance, ASCAP Film and Television Music Awards 1998, and was one of the Top Box Office Films.
Oh, wow. I didn't realize it won that many awards.
It was really that good! Scream 2 seams perfectly from its starting point to up the daring ante, and plonk tongue even further into its cheek.
That is so true. I really wasn't expecting it to be so exciting and such a great follow up.",A really important thing that made it a great follow up was Mrs. Loomis' motive for killing Sidney and her friends was revenge for Sidney killing her son.
MOVDIC-021664,"Thanks... I brought my own.
So... what have you got?
A lottery ticket and a laundry receipt.  I found them in the pocket of that suit you wore the night you were working under cover with a client.
You remember that night, don't ya Ned? Then it hit me. Lottery starts with L-O. Laundry starts with L-A. L- O... L-A. Lola.
Don't sweat it. It's the way a woman's mind works.
How about Ovaltine?
Fine. Then I remembered you told me some guy named Frank had been working on your wife's car for two months. You with me so far?
I'm way ahead of you.
Well back it up. You probably took a wrong turn. Remember your insurance policy... the one we couldn't find? I started thinking, who else had access to it beside you and me? The answer came up... Lana. And since she's a woman, it's probably hidden right here.
So that's where she hid the Oreos.","Ned, Lana wasn't trying to save your life when she shot Max Shady. She and Frank were plotting to kill you and collect on your insurance policy. But she shot the wrong guy."

However... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the Un-American Activities Committee when they open hearings in Los Angeles. Now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.
And I won't be a communist anymore.
Exactly.
So it doesn't make any difference that I'm not one now, and have never been one.
Kid, don't get philosophical with me. This is a game, but it's not your game. You play by their rules, or they'll ruin you. And they have the power to do it.
Doesn't it bother anyone that this is a perversion of democracy?
Darling, don't kid yourself. We don't have a ""democracy"" in this country. The Declaration of Independence? The Constitution? These are pieces of paper with signatures on 'em. And you know what a piece of paper with a signature is? It's a contract. And you know what a contract is? Something that can be re-negotiated at any time.

HOLLED-001389,"Which scene did you like the most in the movie?
I liked the one in which he first went to the house
I loved how suspenseful the whole movie was.
I also liked the part where Arthur makes a daguerotype go round, and he sees for a split second, the dark eyes of the woman in black.
That scene really caught me by surprise! I was on the edge of my seat.
I really like this movie. Good haunted house movie, with great sets and a decent story.
I liked the fresh spin this movie put on classic horror tropes.","As much as this movie drew on the horror standards, I found it refreshingly different from most horror movies."
MOVDIC-008972,"Of course we are. Our primal urges are still there -- but we've taken sex and intellectualized it, refined it down to its most essential components. It's bland, easy, mechanical. There's great passion in the struggle -- such craving in denial. Do you know what it's like to yearn for something? I'm not talking about wanting, or needing. I'm talking about an urge so deep that your skin burns and every cell in your body pulses with desire?
I think we're getting a little off the subject here.
I thought the subject was sex?
As it pertains to you -- not me.  Did you always know you had different... tastes?
Yes.
How?
I don't know if it's something I can explain to you.

Because -- it's beyond intellect. It's emotion. It's passion. It has to be experienced -- it can't be imagined.",Try.

CMUDOG-000239,"Yeah it is kind of crazy you haven't seen it.  It really has everything you'd want.  Lohan's character is pretty awesome.  As a viewer I loved the plot against the Mean Girls to teach them a revenge. did you go to a public school
I did until until my algebra teacher disrespected me in front of the whole class so I slapped him up side his head and went to online.
Wow! Lohan's character had been homeschooled up to this point so operating with all the various cliques in a public high school was new to her.  How did you deal with cliques in school
I made my own cliques with friends that also didn't care about anything. but after a school event called Challenge Day I feel it really impacted the way the whole school treated eachother
Challenge day.  Our local high school has that too.  I've heard great things over the years about that.  That is more productive than what happened in Mean Girls.  I don't suppose challenge day would make for a good movie though.  Lohan's character was kind of used by both cliques to get at each other. It's pretty funny.  The ""mean girls"" who were called the plastics had this ""burn book"" that was pretty terrible but funny for a movie.  Lohan's character leaks the book to the whole school and causes a stir.  It reminded me of all the crazy rumor in high school. Sound anything like your school
yes. i think 
most schools have the same. social ways
Actually in one way there is a scene kind of like challenge day. The teacher that was supposedly a drug dealer made everyone meet and talk it out.  I won't give away the ending but it doesn't go well for the worst offender.  Did most people participate in challenge day>
yes, there were only a hand full of people that didn't attend  and they either skipped or stayed and did work packets
Is there anything you wish you would have said to peers that were mean to you?
I said everything I wanted to say; sometimes forced to make a scene. but I made sure they knew. most of the time I would be the one to get detention",Lohan's character gets sucked into all the drama at school and eventually pays the price for her own misdeeds.  For a while she is an outcast.  The movie has so many ups and downs.  It made me remember how turbulent high school was at times. That's great you got to say your piece.  Eventually Lohan was able to be honest with her peers too. There is one really funny scene that fate gives the meanest girl revenge.  It felt great that Lohan's character didn't do it.  You ever experience anything like that?

Yes, but it was a long time ago, before technology made this type of impersonation more difficult.
In today's society do you think Frank stood a chance as a root repeated offender",No I think he would be in prison for life.

Are you trying to say better attempts at fantasy film making have been shot on camcorders across the globe in people's back yards.
Well the acting was terrible all around.
Among the more notable features of the otherwise poorly received film are cameo appearances by Richard O'Brien (in a parody of his TV program The Crystal Maze) and Tom Baker.

yeah , i seem to hear that place mentioned a lot by lebron james . lebron was also one of the only three number one picks in the nba draft that have gone on to win championships in the last 20 years .
i wasn ' t aware of that ! that is unbelievable , isn ' t it ? heck i couldnt believe stephen curry ' s real name is actually wardell , named after his father . i always assume stephen is a first / real name .
i think steph or stephen curry fits him a lot better , the name wardell seems way too mature and adds about a hundred years old on him . he is very smart too , he even noticed that nike forgot to change durant ' s name in the powerpoint they presented him to convince him of an endorsement deal so he went on to sign with under armour , wonder if it is as lucrative as iverson ' s .
sad nike of all companies were so unprepared for that meeting with a high caliber player like curry . but he ' s better off with under armor , in my opinion anyway . that makes me lose a lot of respect for nike !
yeah i agree , i wonder what happened to the team or person responsible for putting together those slides and whether or not curry called them out on it the moment he saw it . i imagine a lot of executives had the deer in headlights look just as tim duncan ' s fans did when he chose to stay in college instead of going directly into the nba and lose out on some money .
agreed and i believe that was a wise decision on duncan ' s part and worked out for the better . so are you a fan of the golden state warriors ? i can ' t believe they were actually founded in philadelphia before moving to the bay area in 1962 !
yes i am a fan of the warriors , that is like polar opposite in terms of geography ! i have never attended a live game though , so not sure what a cow palace is when they were forced to play there because their usual venue was fully booked . have you attended a live game ?
ha ! that is so true ! i ' ve seen the arena before years ago but never been inside or attended a live game . would love to see a game at the oracle arena someday . i love that name for an arena as well !
that is a great name , it just sounds like a place where success is made unlike where the headquarters of the nba is , it ' s located in the olympic tower in new york , i ' d like to visit new york some day .","same here ! i bet the headquarters is amazing considering nba athletes are the world ' s best paid players at least by the average annual salary per player . so i ' d imagine based on that , the headquarters must be phenomenal . well it was great chatting with you ! until next time . . ."

MOVDIC-050962,"I see them, Mia! I see them! Over there against the dark, stormy sky. They are all there. The smith and Lisa and the knight and Raval and JÂˆns and Skat. And Death, the severe master, invites them to dance. He tells them to hold each other's hands and then they must tread the dance in a long row. And first goes the master with his scythe and hourglass, but Skat dangles at the end with his lyre. They dance away from the dawn and it's a solemn dance towards the dark lands, while the rain washes their faces and cleans the salt of the tears from their cheeks.",You with your visions and dreams.

Was Major Larry in the next one as well?
And I'm pretty young, but I can still appreciate that the effects were good for its time.
They critiqued it as too gruesome for any aged children back then, haha kids now would chuckle compared to what they see now.
Yeah, he comes back for the sequel.
Hard to believe it was created in 1975, didn't know it was done that long before I was born.
I'm surprised that kids today aren't scarred for life with some of the shows they somehow watch(probably behind their parents' backs).

DECODE-005286,"I really like to watch all  of the old tv shows that were on when I was a kid. I watch them with my kids sometimes. But they usually just make me feel really old when we do this.
That's funny, it's like you can see your kids and see yourself experiencing it when you were a kid
That exactly how I feel. I build computers for a living and I always try to do it through the eyes of what my kids would like.

TPCCHT-010459,"did you ever play tetris when you were younger ?
i loved teris on game boy ! how about you ?
sure did . i heard there is a new version available for the playstation 4 . and you can actually play it in virtual reality grabbing the blocks with your hands .
read that as well . never considered tetris to be the type of game that a vr environment would improve upon .
i wish i could afford a vr system . my son has one for his pc . i played it and was totally addicted . i was thinking of getting the one with playstation 4 if i can ever get enough money . i also want to get dead red redemption 2 . i heard a reviewer say it was "" jaw dropping "" good .
vr scares me some , especially when designers are trying to get you addidcted
i was thinking about how people just sit in chairs hours on end staring straight ahead doing vr . then i started thinking people used to do that with tv . after coming home from work and eating dinner they would sit in front of the tv staring straight ahead not moving for hours until they went to bed . at least with vr you are moving your hands and with some games your whole body .
absolutely agree and tetris is a puzzle game that requires fast thinking , geometric skills , and other brain skills . the jazz music will also serve to stimulate brain synapsis , so not all bad i guess
i was surprised to find out that playing it has positive effects . like for people suffering from ptsd . or those trying to stick to diets . i might start playing the original version again until i can get a ps4 .
that is an interesting fact . there are a few versions available on android and apple devices for free . but yeah , the vr set up is going to be a super high demand product , especially for the age group that played it as a game boy game",i play gta 5 on my ps3 now . i am really into flight simulators and that one is the best for console i think until i get a pc that can handle one . i can ' t believe ps3s are researching black holes .
CORMOV-015729,"What do I want to do?

My favorite character was Seth because he was funny and smart.
And might I add looked horribly disgusting in this movie.
Well, He no longer wore clothes, his skin has become swollen and lumpy, and more of his body parts have fallen off and he barely resembles his old self.
Again, look horribly disgusting to say the least! The special effects were great and He surely played that part!
(Jeff Goldblum is excellent in the lead role), and adds a level of serious reflection on the very nature of human mortality to the raw shock
It was like watching a science project go wrong but still had to turn it in to the teacher for a grade.

That sounds interesting.   Is Mean Girls the name of the movie we are chatting about?
Yes, my apologies for giving the wrong name. The movie is very engaging and puts bullying into a comedic light. It's entertaining and eye openeing as well",Would it be appropriate to watch with my 12 year old granddaughter?

well , i cheered the us on all the time , but only jumped up and down when they won : ) . 2022 will be in qatar . i hear they ' ll air condition the stadiums .
do they usually not air condition the stadiums ? it ' s a good thing they decided to use all that money they make to something good . soccer makes more money than football , basketball , baseball , golf , tennis , and hockey combined ! does that mean soccer players get more lucrative salaries ?
they play outside , so no air conditioning . but qatar is hot . i suppose they ' ll play in domes . i know the top soccer players make a lot . not sure if it ' s more than the other sports .
oi , those type of climates sitting in the hot sun really establishes a case for air conditioned stadiums ! i wonder how the word "" soccer "" came to be a slang for association football , which is what it is formerly called or more commonly as football or soccer .
maybe "" association "" turned into sock - ur somehow . they play it in 200 countries so not everyone uses the same terms , of course .
oh ! that ' s genius and creative ! even though they don ' t use the same terms , they should learn a thing or two from the german soccer player who donated his $ 300k world cup victory bonus to pay for surgeries for 23 children in brazil , how commendable !
there ' s also didier drogba , who helped stop a civil war in the ivory coast . he ' s a big star there . some athletes do good work off the field .
yes , those who use their platforms to do good deserve all their successes . how many players usually play on a team for soccer because there is a variation of soccer where only 3 people play on a team . i ' m guessing that ' s not what we see normally in the world cup .
it ' s normally 11 on the field at a time , but you can use 3 substitutes during the game . they run about 7 miles a game , so some of them are probably tired at the end of a match .","oh my goodness ! run and seven miles , they really need those substitutes ! jon stewart , the talk show host is also a skilled soccer player and he played in college and even represented the games , he ' s so talented ! any other talented celebrities you know ?"

Yes no matter what we have basic life issues will never really change. They'll just come about in a new way.
that was a pretty good scene (the new paragraph). kind of hinted at things remaining worse for the guy/son but eventually they fought their way back. cool to see the human spirit reflected in robots

yeah the robots don't change the human life, they just augment it. nothing intrinsic is lost
Right. I suppose in many ways we were really supposed to see the robots as humans - more so than the actual humans. That's a really
 interesting concept, I think.

Yeah.
You know why I'm such a good officer? Because of my mother. Have I ever told you about her?
Bits and pieces.
She's the best poker player you ever saw. My father used to go to these Saturday night games and lose his shirt. Finally, my mother gave him an ultimatum, either she gets a regular seat at the table or she locks him in every Saturday night. He squawked and so did his buddies but after a while they gave in and from the first night she sat down, she never lost. She could read those cocky bastards like they were playing open hands. And he bluffs? He had sixteen levels of bullshit. Her eyes, the tone of her voice, her bets, her jokes, the way she sipped her coffee, she was a master. She won more money on shit hands than anyone in the history of the game. Every Saturday night, my father would lose two, three hundred bucks and she'd win it all back and then some. And I'd stand there, glued to her shoulder, from the time I was five years old, watching every hand, every move, studying how she did it.  That's why I'm such a good officer, I can look at a man's face and tell you exactly what he's holding, and if it's a shit hand, I know just what cards to deal him.
And what about your own hand?
No problem. A pair of deuces? Less? So what? I bluff. It used to tear me apart when I'd get one of my men killed, but what was I supposed to do? Break down in front of the ones who were standing there waiting for me to tell them what to do? Of course not, so I bluffed, and after a while, I started to fall for my own bluff. It was great, it made everything so much easier. Sarge Is that why your hand's been shaking?
It could be worse. You know the first thing they teach you at O.C.S.?
Oh, yeah?
Not in so many words, but they tell you you can have all the firepower in the world and if your men don't have good morale, it's not worth a damn.

I thought it dated back to 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe",The term comic book derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone
CMUDOG-000406,"Yeah, I really liked that aspect, it made it more realistic.  I did find it complicated but I think I understood most of it.
I really liked the characters. They each had a specialty and the actors that portrayed them, really sold me on the characters. It is complex, for sure. I think it will unfold more over multiple viewings.
Leonardo was great in it, even his character was layered.
Yesss! He's so good in this kind of role. He has the depth!
Did you liked the first scene ? I think it was great to explain the concept of infiltrating dream.
Yes, I did. I think infiltrating dream is completely brilliant because you can do so much with it. There aren't rules, so to speak. It really feels like this could happen in real life almost. Don't you think?
Yeah, it has just enough sci-fi to make it interesting, but leaving the rest as normal as possible. How did you liked the scene where they start to infiltrate the dreams of Robert Fisher ? I really liked how they explained the kick system.
Precisely. Did you like that Fischer basically armed himself against attack in his subconscious? I think these concepts get us thinking while watching.
Yeah, it made the film more realistic and gave the film more tension.
I did too. I think the kick system is super fascinating! It made me think about how long it may have taken them to figure out how to do that, you know after perhaps lots of people getting stuck!. Right, more action. What do you think about the concept of the totem? It's so visceral, literally!",I think the scene where they explained the backstory with Mal added a lot of depth and layers to the film. And the totem was like a recurrent theme throughout the film.

HOLLED-008434,"What is your opinion about the movie?
I think it was ahead of its time
What about the movie makes you think that it was ahead of its time?
I have to admit I enjoyed the movie from start to finish - because of the amazing set- and creature-design and the more than decent action sequences and special effects.
What did you think about the other aspects of the movie?
When I watched it yesterday I got angry at times because some of the dialogue - well, most of it, actually - is truly awful.
All of the reviews I have read agree that the dialogue is disappointing.
I completely understand why this movie got such terrible reviews; after all, it marked the first ""let's make a quick buck"" entry in the two beloved Alien and Predator franchises and was done by a director who many felt didn't treat the material with the respect it deserved.
Nevertheless, it did well at the box office, correct?","Yes, it earned $80,281,096 at the box office."

WOWIKI-017332,"Hi there. Our topic today is cheesecake - what a great topic. I absolutely love cheeseckae - who doesn't right? My favourite layer is the biscuit base, particularly if ginger biscuits are mixed in with the graham crackers.
Where did Cheesecake originate?
That's an interesting question. Cheesecake is believed to have originated in Greece, and they think that it was fed to athletes during the first Olympic Games in 776 B.C. My favourite flavours are the fruity ones rather than vanilla or chocolate. What do you like?
I like strawberry cheesecake. What is the most popular flavor around the world?","I'm not sure what the most popular flavour is. I know you get different sorts of cheesecake, in that it can be baked or just refrigerated, and that you get lots of different flavours. Yes I liked strawberry cheesecake too, and my mum makes a mean cherry cheesecake."
MOVDIC-064782,"And you're not the boy's legal guardian?
I don't even know if that's my kid!
They just showed up! We never seen them before...",I used to know his sister --
MOVDIC-015034,"I knew she would intrigue you.
She needs direction... and training.
She's an aristocrat's daughter. She's not one of us. In any case, it will all be over soon. You'll kill Fox, and she'll marry.
That's not for her. She should come to Wudan and become a disciple.
But Wudan does not accept women.
For her, they might make an exception. If not, I'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.
It's not our affair. Even if Wudan accepts her, her husband might object.
I thought by giving away the sword, I could escape the Giang Hu world.
I wish there were something more I could do to help you.
Just be patient with me, Shu Lien.",Lo?
DECODE-028599,"Hello, I am interested in hair coloring, or hair dyeing, It is cool to change hair color
I think it is too. I changed my hair color in the past from black to dark blonde, it was interesting.
did you bleach it to make it blonde?
Not really, I do not like bleaching, I just used a regular hair dye and surprisingly it worked, just turned out a different shade than expected.
Yes it can damage hair, it is so interesting 75% of women in some cities like Copenhagen use hair dye
This sounds like a lot. It doesn't surprise me though, women like change, it's boring to always look the same.
Yes it is, and there is huge money spent on it, like $1.9 billion in 2011
Wow, well sometimes it's worth it to spend money on looks. Even though dyeing hair can damage hair permanently. It's hard to get back to natural color.","Yes It is, but when it is done professionally by hairdresser it can damage less"

I liked the one in which Coffey's healing powers are revealed.
I think that was the turning point of the movie, I didn't really enjoy it up until that point.
Yes and the story is faithful to the book, only losing details that were not important to the story anyway.
I didn't even know it was a book, have you read it?
""The Green Mile"" is one of my favorite Stephen King books and I have read it several times.
Stephen King has so many great books turned into novels.","I know, it's another steven King movie that people don't realise is his, like shawshank redemption. Good shit."

Usually at the point when she's got to rewrite and rethink them to keep the audience from leaving the theater!

Yep the show follows the misadventures of the last surviving man on earth, Arthur Dent, following the demolition of the planet Earth by a alien race called the Vogon constructor fleet in order to make way for a hyperspace bypass.
Wow, that sounds exciting!  Do the movies follow the same plot?
Yes they follow it somewhat, The main characters on the show are Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Zaphod Beeblebrox, Marvin the Paranoid Android, Trillian, and Slartibartfast.",This sounds like something I would enjoy - I'm going to check it out!

Just make sure you're not caught. If you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. If you find nothing -- he's clear.
At the risk of sounding stuffy, Jeff -- I'll remind you of the Constitution, and the phrase ""search warrant"" issued by a judge who knows the Bill of Rights verbatim. He must ask for evidence.

Hahaha good answer! I am terrified of dinosaurs, though. Never made sense because I love birds.
Imagine a black bird, except 75 feet tall.  The way they move and everything would indeed be terrifying if they were that big.

A little bit, but I have gone back and watched some of those older mysteries.  There was one show that starred Pierce Brosnan, but I can't remember the name of it.  I watched the whole series and it was great.
Could that have been Remington Steele? It was like a romantic comedy/drama/detective type show.
It was Reminton Steele.  I loved that show!

I know you do, Tom. Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do. If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas.

They are really good for the mice situation I have a friend that had a roof problem where mice were in her building and her cat actually caught one . It would have freaked me out though lol.

TPCCHT-008853,"the qb definitely has a lot to do with how well a team does . though since an nfl game only has about 11 of live gameplay , i wonder how much of it is used by the qb
the qb touches the ball on every play some i would guess at least one third of the gameplay . he holds it longer on a pass than on a hand - off . your team bowed out because the play - offs are indeed single elimination . it is not like baseball .
definitely not , though best out of seven is a lot to watch and causes even more traffic than the playoffs do . whether it ' s the nfl or mlb , the average engineer is still likely to make more money in a lifetime than the average player . though qb ' s are typically above average
my next door neighbor was a running back and made $ 7 million in one season . i started as an engineer and made about $ 4 . 5 million in my career . one of us is not average ! . there is one high school stadium in texas that cost $ 60 million to build .
he must have been a good player . i ' ve heard those texans really love their football . i wonder how many in the nfl draft actually came from a high school in texas compared to other states
i ' ll bet it is high . high school football on a friday night is huge in texas . that stadium seats 18 , 000
players on that team are probably used to playing under a lot of pressure . i wonder how big the stadium was when georgia tech beat cumberland 220 - 0 back in 1916 ? then again , that game would have gotten boring seeing all those touchdowns from the same team !
it would be like watching a horror movie . i was on a high school jv team that lost to the varsity of a smaller school by 74 - 0 . they ran the clock in the second half even on incomplete passes . there needs to be a mercy rule .
maybe that ' s why the score was so high . there was a high school jv team that not only lost , but failed to score a touchdown the whole season . the backup qb , whom they never put in , was tom brady . big mistake there
that is a story for the ages . the 3 highest paid employees in the department of defense are the football coaches at the service academies .","of course they are . football is where the money is now . though some , like baker mayfield , almost quit football to do competitive gaming . i guess he stuck to it as the qb of the university of oklahoma"

i ' m sure we ' ll always have a problem with trees . i know we are going to be helium free by the end of the 21st century so that is sad as well !","that is wild to think , i wonder what the balloon companies will do to survive ?"

I need to book a large party at a really nice restaurant tonight.

CORMOV-031814,"Hi, Mickey...",What the hell do you think you're doing...?  What's going on here...?
TPCCHT-007131,"the white house has a guest house . the guest house is bigger than the white house ! did you know that the white house still uses floppy disks ? i wonder when they ' ll join the 21st century .
i think they use floppy disks because they are harder to hack , you know the only president with a phd is woodrow wilson .
i think that makes him too qualified for the office . i thought that trump would be one of the wealthiest presidents , but i guess three others were wealthier than him .
what are the names of those presidents ? i thought trump was like the richest one in history .
jfk . washington . jefferson . i guess that last two owned a lot of land . did you know the president of zimbabwe was called president banana ? i wonder how he liked that .
thats funny lol , you know in guatemala close relatives of a former president cant run for office .
that sounds like a measure against nepotism . the country probably had problems with that in the past . maybe the relatives can release pop albums like the president of indonesia .
yeah maybe like communism , lincoln was photographed next to booth , it seems like he was the first president to be photographed .
he probably never took a selfie . now that would have made him popular with millennials . until 1805 , the runner - up became vice president . i think we should reinstate that , just for entertainment sake .
can you imagine if that rule still applied , a trump and clinton office ?",it would be a sit - com for the ages . i bet they would argue about everything . who gets the guest house ? trump would want to put it on airbnb .

TPCCHT-007215,"hi ! do you follow the government at all ? i find it awfully ironic that wikileaks published the government ' s plans to destroy them . ha !
i ' ve always followed the government closely . unfortunately it ' s become a reality show lately so it ' s been even easier to follow . ha - assange is never getting out of ecuador .
that is so very true ! i even often wonder what the government does with the 86 % of the land it owns in nevada as well .
haha well that probably includes area 51 right ?
probably so ! i ' m sure whatever they do , it ' s very shady ! it ' s just too bad all governments can ' t be like norwegia where their government donated $ 1 billion to save the amazon rainforest back in 2008 ! that was so nice of them !
crazy . did you know that every president with a beard has been a republican ?
now that ' s crazy ! i also think it ' s crazy we haven ' t had a non - democrat or non - republican president since 1853 !
i don ' t you how feel , but i think we desperately need a third party . i feel like the republicans and the democrats are losing their touch .
that ' s exactly how i feel ! we need someone who isn ' t red or blue . speaking of those colors , did you know the two parties didn ' t start using those colors consistently until 2000 ?
what color would a third party pick ? although white would be the last color of the usa , i think it would be insensitive to call the party that .",that ' s a good point ! we need someone like theodore roosevelt to break away and form a new party like he did in 1912 forming the bull moose party after being rejected by the gop !
CMUDOG-001279,"I do find it interesting they didn't get him in on the movie. I wonder if it's because he refused to do it or they  decided just not to contact him?
I think he didn't want to get involved with the whole Hollywood scene and perhaps the movie doesn't make him look as good as he would like. Because in the movie, Facebook started as a whole Hot or Not program, which is slightly offensive haha
That's what I was thinking. I figured the movie made him look like a bad guy and he didn't want to get anything additionally bad tagged to him. That and he may be trying to stay away from the lime light with something like that
I think that the Winklevoss twins also looked bad in the movie, like they were trying to take credit of everything.
It looks like it! I'm wondering if they were trying to just make him do the dirty work and them get all the ladies for it or if they could really see the big picture with Facebook and it's future
That's a good point. I remember when this movie came out and everyone was talking about it. Do you think this movie was successful?
I think initially it definitely successful. I don't know if it was impactful. You think this will be a classic movie that is remembered or just another controversial movie?
I think that it is a classic movie just because not many like it have been made. But I also think a lot of its success came from the Facebook craze and not the quality of the movie itself
I think it will be definitely remembered for this time era. With the different controversies that went with it, which one do you think was most surprising? The sex, money or betrayal?
I think the betrayal was more surprising because it started as a team effort so it was sad to see the team members become greedy",What do you think of the phrase 'facebook me' you think it's almost as popular as saying to 'google' something?

Nell, you have to hear me. Let me explain what's happening to you.  You're participating in a study on hysteria. Everyone but Marrow REACTS. MARROW  I've given you a powerful suggestion that you're in a haunted house. I picked Hill House because it fits the expectations. It was my... it was my theater, my stage.
Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations. You brought us here to scare us. Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue. You're disgusting.
Is this true? I've been hypnotized?","I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance. Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell. A communal story. Someone starts it. Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it. This story shapes what we see and hear. We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it. That's what this experiment has all been about. That's what it was about, the experiment's over. I'm pulling the plug. This is my fault."

I think it was good movie.
I enjoyed it but i think i need to read the book so i can enjoy it more when next i watch it.
When you read the book you will realize that although Cocteau adapted the story, he took it to new limits, he dramatically expanded the scope, and most of all, he wiped out an obsolete grating moral.",I really learnt a lot from the movie. It was impact full.

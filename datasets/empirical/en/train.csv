WOWIKI-011386,"One of my friends was recently diagnosed with Obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a mental disorder where people feel the need to check things repeatedly,
Yes, exactly! My friend can not stand when things are placed on a table out of line.
It makes one unable to control either the thoughts or the activities for more than a short period of time.
Wow, I did not know that it made one unable to control their thoughts. That is an interesting bit of information.
Such routine as hand washing, counting of things, and checking to see if a door is locked.

HOLLED-008975,"Which is your favourite character in this?
My favorite character was billy costigan as he has great development through the story.
Now I know that 'The Departed' is based off of the Hong Kong movie 'WuJianDao', but Scorsese really grabs hold of a great story and brings it to the American Screen.
I was quite underwhelmed by this movie as well. There's some good ingredients in the plot, but the movie just never really managed to get me emotionally involved enough with the characters.
Indeed the Departed felt flashy and well-executed in terms of the actors, dialogue, and production values, but lacked depth. (Almost the polar opposite of Last Temptation in that respect.) As for the Best Picture win, the Academy is notorious for giving out de facto lifetime achievement awards for somewhat arbitrary movies if a respected director or actor has yet to win the appropriate award.
Oh yes, I'm pretty sure this is what happened with Scorsese and The Departed. See also: Al Pacino and Scent of a Woman, Leo and The Revenant.",And it has Superb acting on top of brilliant storytelling

jennifer lee , the writer and co - director , is the first woman director of a walt disney animation studios feature film .
wow . after so long , disney is finally woke ! i believe she is also the first woman director of a feature film that earned more than $ 1 billion in gross box office revenue .
yes ! before "" let it go "" was written elsa was the main villain in frozen , however the song was so uplifting her character was changed instead of the song .
im glad they changed it ! the co - writer of that song let it go , robert lopez , is 1 of 12 people to have ever won an egot : emmy , grammy , oscar , and tony . what a talent !
nice ! disney renamed "" rapunzel "" to "" tangled "" and "" snow queen "" to "" frozen "" because they blamed feminine titles for underperforming box offices . odd .

yep same as nirvana , i still listen to them pretty often , and the with streaming services it is easier than ever to listen to whatever you want from any age .
very true . i love nirvana as well . i could just listen to music all day everyday instead of watching tv and be fine with it lol . one of my all time fav old albums is dark side of the moon . it was released over 40 years ago and still one of the best selling albums .

yeah , the nfl has its humble beginnings . it has come a long way . now the players are stars and they make serious bank .
i get a lot of heck here in boston as the patriots won the last superbowl , the chiefs last superbowl was when nixon was president but i still where red . interesting up until 1978 tennis players could use any object as a racket , have you ever seen a list of objects used ? i have to think there were a few creative attempts at getting an advantage in the early days of professional tennis .
i guess . i dont know much about tennis . i suppose that players could try to get an advantage but in the end it is about playing ability and coaching i would say .
yes , i would agree with you . we talk about the budget deficit we passing on to our kids , but did you see the us military operates 234 gold courses world - wide at a cost of $ 140 , 000 , 000 . i ' d think if we got serious about balancing the budge there ' s some some room there to pare back the expenses .
perhaps but the military runs on golf . major decisions are made on the course . nothing can get done without officers drinking and golfing .","haha , yes , we might be crippled if we didn ' t have them . speaking of low cost sports , i must be a luddite . did you know the official name of the game i call ping pong is actually table tennis and ping pong is actually sells table tennis equipment . i ' ve been calling it by the wrong name all these years ."

Not yet, they did not. The new multiplayer mode is suppose to be coming soon which will make the game much more fun.
There's another game that let's you explore the universe, our known universe, Space Engine, its really indepth

You usually don't get that much jail time for drunk driving if it is your first incident. It shouldn't be so bad, but hopefully it will make you more cautious in the future.
It's my 2nd offense so I am terrified. I think I'm looking at a month or two in jail.",Oh wow. I really hope that you get the help you need.

no idea , i feel bad for the saints ' cheerleader though , they can ' t be in the same place as the football player
i don ' t like how some nfl teams have strange rules like if the cheerleaders are at a restaurant and the football players show up the cheerleaders are expected to leave . very strange .
yea those rules on cheerleaders and players are outdated and sexist
lol those were the same rules you meant ? it is very odd . i think it might have started because it would be too distracting for the cheerleaders and football players to have relationships together ?
i don ' t think that ' s an issue on the professional level .
true . i think there ' s actually a music video made based off of that with football players and cheerleaders like that . i think it ' s interesting no females have played for the nfl .
maybe there will be a female place kicker soon since there are no rules forbidding women from playing
that sounds like it would be reasonable . i think the average football game only has just over ten minutes of play . think of how much time that leaves for commercials !

i wonder if any of the hand signals have an signifigance in asl since there are deaf and hard of hearing players on the teams .
that ' s a good point . in the 60s bowlers made twice as much as football stars . still , i wonder how much bowlers made overall . was it that much money ?
i think back then the players in the nfl weren ' t getting the exorbident sums they are now . given all the injuries they sustain though i think the pay is mostly justified .
on a per - minute basis , they make a great wage . there is only 11 minutes of action on average .
that has to be without the huddles and hikes and all that because there is a clock that ticks down . i think it must be 11 minutes of actual moving .
did you know that there is only one left - handed quarterback in the nfl ? kellan moore . i expected more , considering how many lefty pitchers there are in the mlb .
i didn ' t know that . i wonder if it is because of the way the ball is thrown and caught . it seems like it would be harder to do lefthanded than with say a baseball .
i wonder if the plays have to be reworked for a lefty . the receiver routes and such

It's possible, yes, but they're more appropriate for northern regions because of temperature, as they're an arctic breed. Speaking of arctic people, the term ""husky"" came from Eskimos originally.

States government in the Vietnam War.

It's more about a newspaper in the states, but it regards things that happened in the war that they reveal to the public

Rotten Tomatoes gives it 88%
In 1966 Vietnam, State Department military analyst Daniel Ellsberg accompanies U.S.
troops in combat, documenting the progress of U.S. military activities in the region for
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara. On the return flight home, McNamara expresses
to Ellsberg and William Macomber his view that the war in Vietnam is hopeless, yet, upon
landing, McNamara expresses his confidence in the war effort. Ellsberg overhears this, and
becomes disillusioned. Years later, now working for the RAND Corporation, a civilian
military contractor, Ellsberg surreptitiously photocopies classified reports documenting the
country's decades-long involvement in the conflict in Vietnam, dating back to the Truman
administration. Ellsberg then leaks these documents to reporters at The New York Times.

I liked the one in which Mozart is caught runnign with two ladies.
Really!? I may have to watch it again fully to take in the love of it. It was very deep though.
OH! This movie is WONDERFUL, this movie is BEAUTIFUL! I just love it, and not because of my fixation on Mozart, but because it is a beautifully made, completely moving work of art
The title of the movie make you think documentary, like why not just title it Mozart?
Look at the connotative meaning of the name ""Amadeus:"" In Latin it means ""Loved by God."" It's so perfect, so fitting that this should be the title.
Salieri's confession, when he was talking to the priest, I knew something was off with him.","Exactly, when He was reminisces about his youth, particularly about his devotion to God and his love for music and how he pledges to God to remain celibate as a sacrifice if he can somehow devote his life to music.

Agreed! I thoroughly agree with the 92% rating,. Did you see it in IMAX? The 70mm screen was impressive.
Same here, I typically look at metacritic over rotten tomatoes, and sometimes they can vary vastly in their ratings, but even on metacritic it got a 94!","Yes, the critical ratings were very consistent."

It is a very popular activity. It is sad that many people cannot swim.

In my humble opinion this film manages to be both Wes Anderson's funniest picture so far and his most melancholic.
I love he’s movies and am surprised I haven’t seen this one yet. Why did you like it so much?
Because The utter uncompromising stylishness of his other work is also present here, perhaps even heightened, but in contrast to The Life Aquatic (and to a certain degree The Darjeeling Limited), the emphasis here is firmly on plot.",Fantastic.

Chew? Toby Chew? No.
It hurts. It hurts her. It shouldn't hurt. Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now. But when this cat fucks her, it hurts. It hurts like the first time. The pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. Hence, ""Like a Virgin."" The fellas crack up.

I agree fully, do you often look at who is involved in distribution? is that ever a deal breaker for you?
Not really. I'm not extremely involved in the behind the scenes of movies. Did you enjoy the presence of Phil Coulson?
I did, however not as much as Samuel L. Jackson. Were you overall impressed with the cast selection?
Yes, I was. Like I stated earlier, everyone seemed suitable for the character they were cast to play. I think Samuel L. Jackson commanded well and was intimidating in a sense and exuded a great ""director of ""S.H.I.E.L.D."" aura.

hahha . . . yes . . . . my fingers were going faster than my mind ! lol
ha ha . no problem . did you know that the guest house is larger than the white house ? i wonder why .
i didn ' t know that . up until 1805 the runner up in the us presidential race automatically became the vice president .
can you imagine that now ? we are so partisan . would it be a complete disaster or would it force us to work together more and not vilify each other as much ?
i thought the same thing myself . i ' m wondering if it would work better and force them to stop fighting among both parties . although it could have the reverse effect too and cause chaos . lol
very true . i would be very curious about that . did you also know that the president of indonesia put out 3 pop albums while he was in office ?
now that sounds funny . i wonder how the country was doing while he was recording those . lol did you know that hillary clinton won a grammy for best spoken work album ?
i did not . do you know what spoken work it was for ?
yes . it was for the audio recording of her book "" it takes a village "" .",i don ' t remember that book but i will have to look into it . did you also know that if you zoom into the white house on google maps you can see barack obama ? !

HOLLED-007860,"What is your opinion about the movie?
I think it was an odd film
Yes the movie explores themes of nostalgia and modernism.
There's something about the midnight hour, something special, mystical, and magical.
The film is set in several time periods, and Paris glows intensely and seductively in everyone of those.
Especially where Gil comes to realize that he has been transported to the 1920s, an era he admires and idolizes in the novel he is writing.
Performances are outstanding all around, with Cotillard once again stealing every second she is on the screen.
She attracts many types, but her philosophy is unique, move on, enjoy, live the moment","""Midnight in Paris"" is a beautiful display of what movie magic can truly create, a sense of wonder long gone from contemporary cinema"

well , they are human and therefore fallible . hopefully the nfl will revise the rules to allow coaches to challenge bad calls and no call situations . but the pats do have the highest rate of offensive drives with defensive penalties called on the opposing team !
i agree though , they truly do get a lot of calls , but they are disciplined ( the patriots ) to an extent as well
they are a well oiled machine with the belichick / brady combo at the helm . did you know the game of throne ' s author calls the pats the "" lannisters "" of the nfl ?
i did not , but they certainly are a machine , they have only won a superbowl by at most 6 points though , i find that very interesting
brady was bottled up for the first 1 / 2 and only found a hole thru the rams defense in the 2nd 1 / 2 . but it was enough to guarantee him a slot on pats roster for next year . what i find surprising is that tom ' s wife makes more that twice what he does . i would have thought it would have been the other away around . i did not know models made that much ?
they can if they have other ventures ! brady was picked 199th overall , that is a crazy oversight by many teams
i heard his collegiate football was lackluster at best , so he really came out and shined in the nfl . do you think the dynamics of the pats head coach belichick brought out the best in brady ?
oh for sure , he was , as you said , picked that low for a reason
i will say this , belichick also knows how to protect brady with the patriots front offensive line . the gronk is pretty solid ! belichick is definitely talented , after all , he is the winningest nfl coach in post season football .","he is , which is very impressive , there are an average of 11 minutes in an nfl game , very small window for error , and he still excels"

After suffering nightmares of his torture from the Collector, he is approached by Lucello, an employee of Elena's wealthy father, who has hired a team of mercenaries to hunt the Collector down and save Elena. Lucello implies that if Arkin leads them to the Collector's hideout, he will expunge Arkin's record. Arkin leads the mercenary group to the Collector's base, an abandoned hotel. Meanwhile, Elena witnesses a man being tortured before escaping from the trunk. Upon the team's arrival, Arkin refuses to go inside, but Lucello forces him at gunpoint to guide them through the hotel. The Collector reenters the room and notices Elena has escaped before being alerted to the team's presence.

Yes, you said that right, a lot of Star Wars, or Star trek inventions became a reality
The difference to fantasy is that it avoids the supernational and often has a foundation in actual science. I love Star Trek as well.
Yes, science fiction can predict the future, but a lot of other shows also, like The Simpsons predicted the Ebola outbreak, have you heard of that?
No, tell me more about it. Isn't Ebola this dangerous virus that can cause internal and external bleeding.
Yes it is, and the Simpsons predicted it in one of their sketches that was filmed back in 1997!","Interesting relationship there between science fiction in a series such as ""The Simpsons"" and global events."

yeah ! i ' m not a gamer so i ' m not too familiar with eve , but i am aware of all the hype surrounding fortnite . the radio talks about it all the time
i ' ve played a few games , but not eve . i ' ve heard it has a bit of a harsh culture . funny how we ' ve come full circle , starting with simple technology like radio and evolving to the internet and hi - tech computers that are talked about . . . on the radio !
that ' s a really great point ! there are even websites that lets you listen to thousands of shows for free , though i ' m not too familiar with what radio dramas are , i think those refer to podcasts . what do you mean by "" harsh culture "" .
sometimes when people have anonymity in a game , they abuse it and treat others badly . most gamers aren ' t like that , but some are very toxic . the two - way communication in games is great , but radio definitely has an advantage of avoiding the anonymous bullying that can crop up in games .
oh my goodness , i ' ve seen how crazy some gamers get when they ' re gaming . thanks for clarifying what the harsh culture means . i heard on the radio today that apple will pay the kid who found the facetime eavesdropping bug and it stemmed from the fact that he wanted to set up group facetime with friends to play fortnite .",i ' m glad they ' re finally fixing that bug . i disabled facetime on my phone as soon as i heard about it . it ' s great that the radio can keep people aware of issues like that !

its just fascinated to watch what the late 80's where like in New York.  Htere is one scene wehre belfort procures a job as a sockbrocker and Mark Hanna, entices him with sex and drugs and teaches him that his only job is to make money for himself.  just to see the mentallity of the time is interesting.
or maybe what happened to belfort since it is more like his records
its definetly not an action packed movie.  its follows his life of getting a job as a broker and then finding his job terminated due to black monday and so he gets a job a a biler room brokerage form doing penny stockes. this explodes and he starts his own firm and makes a small fortune.
and I guess he rose to the top or ??. small fortune, from brokering? or drugs
oh he did, gets the big house, the fancy car, the trophy wife.  and even trains others on what he calls the ""Hard Sell"". brokering. he used the small small fortune to buy drugs though.
does the movie not have critics?
it does. some claim it to be narrow in scope and that some of the characters are dull.
I see,
one critic does claim it to be an irresponsible glorification rather than a satirical takedown.  If you take movies to seriously then i guess i could see this.",but do you agree with that?. the characters being dull?

C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it.We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box .
That's no problem.He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap .

what type of music do you enjoy ? jazz is a personal favorite since when it spread , it absorbed and amalgamated with each national , regional , or local music cultures to develop distinct style of jazz that were both jazz and yet not jazz , maintaining its core essence , but absorbing the best of the existing music culture

what do you think about matthew bellamy considering he has the guinness world record for most guitars smashed during tour ?
that is crazy , but it ' s crazier that aerosmith made more money from guitar hero than from any of their albums .
indeed , guitar hero was an amazingly popular game . i wonder if aerosmith played the guitar with a pick , coin , or fingers ?
maybe they used all three . i find it hard to believe that led zeppelin decided to not name their fourth album so they could confuse the hated rock press .","i didn ' t know that . personally , i enjoy that these artists are so dedicated to their craft . the guitarist of pink floyd even turned a grand houseboat into a recording studio"

So do you agree with the ratings of the movie? Many people find it to be a scary thriller, but others describe it as being too gruesome. What do you think? Do you like this kind of movie?
I found it to be to gruesome and didn't agree with the rating.  But then, I don't like violent movies.
I hear ya. But, maybe you should give it another try! It's a classic movie full of action and suspense. Steven Spielberg never disappoints. Do you typically like Steven Spielberg movies?
I'm not sure as to whether I'd like to give it another try or not,  but then again I liked ET.
Well, like one person put it, it's funny in a Woody Allen sort of way. Since it's a classic, it might not be exactly as you remember. Might be worth the watch even if just for the laughs!
Perhaps the humor is subtle.  I recall not really seeing to much humor in it though,
Well, I suppose the film works for both types of people. Some love it because of its action and because it's a scary thriller, while others find it to be more humorous and funny.
That's true, and it probably also has a lot to do with the types of humor people like, or don't care for.","Yeah, that's true. But, of course, most watch it for the thrill. For example, there is a scene in the movie where a woman named Chrissie Watkins goes skinny dipping in the ocean. While she's in the water, she's suddenly pulled under! It's unexpected and thrilling, one of the reasons why I enjoy this movie. I honestly don't know what else to say...... This has been going on way too long and is honestly silly.

CMUDOG-002782,"Yes I agree with you. Do you agree it was the best animated musical since the death of Howard Ashman?
I don't think it's the best, per say, but it was definitely good. I mean just about every Disney movie has music in it, this one most certainly had a great deal of catchy songs, The Little Mermaid and Beauty and the Beast will forever be my favorites. It's an alright script, but like I said, it's a typical Disney movie, someone falls in love, there's villains, there's magic, there's singing and dancing, problems to overcome. I would probably give it a B+ rating instead of an A+, but that's just me.
Yes it is right. Personally I love Pixar movies and this one seems to have the same approach of one of then, maybe this is why I liked it. What about th
e end of history did you expected more?
I didn't. I kind of predicted what would happen. Seemed logical. How do you feel about the scene where they are kids playing and Elsa accidentally hits Anna with her ""ice power"" and injures her? I feel like her parents went about it the wrong way, making her fear her powers.
Yes for sure. They pressured her to avoid using the power instead of learning how to control then. That was the main cause of all the future problems. What about the trolls village, did you like then?
Even the trolls tell her she must learn to control her powers, but instead she just suppresses what makes her unique. Pretty sad in my opinion. The trolls are great! They definitely add a lot of humor to the movie. I really hated the scene where her parents died at sea. It was kind of messed up, leaving them orphans in a way, I know Elsa was older, but it seemed like there was no one to really guide them through their teenage years. I feel like there was something missing. I didn't understand why Anna had to have her memories of Elsa's magic erased. That seemed kind of dumb to me, like wouldn't it make more sense to keep them there, so she could learn from her mistake. Next time she wouldn't jump around so foolishly and quickly.
Agree with you but it was necessary for the movie. Actually Elsa's insecure was the main component of the drama. But maybe the history could be achieved in a different way as you mentioned.
I understand. I hate how they closed the doors and everything and just left them isolated. I feel like she wouldn't have been so insecure about her powers if they had been more supportive.
Completely agree, trying to keep then apart and without knowing the reason is a bad decision. For sure they were creating problems for the future. Isolation created on Elsa insecure to control her powers and makes Anna willing to fall in love for the first man she meets outside the castle.
Why do you think Elsa remained so distant from Anna even after they opened the doors for the coronation?","Difficult to know, maybe because she knew that Anna loved her but at the same time was the purpose of so many troubles when they where child. Although it was no Anna's fault maybe Elsa was afraid to happen again. Elsa tried to create the ice castle to stay alone as she was in her normal castle right"

DALE was really awesome, where did you watch this movie.
I was lucky enough to get to see this as my first movie at my first festival ever, the Dallas International Film Festival (DIFF)
Wow thats great and what did you think of the movie?
Honestly, this movie was a genius comedy, parodying classic horror to levels that could be considered even better then the likes of Shaun of the Dead.
Right. I was impressed by the indie aspect of the movie.
Truly it is a perfect Indie movie, and the fact that it is only on the festival circuit is a shame. It has the celebrity power of Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine leading the film in a comic tour de force as well as quite a few lesser known young actors acting opposite.
Some of the scenes seem so real, I feel I was present right there at that very moment. Good directing from ELI CRAIG?
I was lucky enough to get a Q & A with Craig as well as meet with him afterwords and gain further insight into this movie that I already very much loved. He stated how some of he always saw this film as a comedy, not a horror film or even a parody of horror films, and as such one thing the big studios that wouldn't produce it had a problem with was the humor in the deaths.

I've never heard of him, did he play with a lot of people?
Yes, his career was a few decades but he played in both trios and orchestras as well as a music producer.
So if you weren't playing as a saxaophonist what would you play as? Do you also play in large groups?
I think I'd want to be in a vocal music ensemble.  Some ensembles consist of just singers, like choirs.","Oh, that's a far throw from jazz playing no? What range do you sing as?"

I would say the Toronto maple leafs of Toronto Canada.
Why do you like them more than other teams?",I think it is because they used to play at the mutual street arena before 1931

Run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back. Because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this.

i have a passing knowledge of football and the nfl . i ' m sure your know that the nfl is among the 4 major sports leagues in north america , but did you know that there is no written rule against female players ?
i did know that . i find it refreshing that they are not sexist but question the american stomach for a female playing against those large men . there is only 11 minutes of playing time .
there sure is a lot of things that go on in those 11 minutes . lately , the nfl have been putting chips in the shoulderpads of players and in the football to gather data for more efficient plays .
i wonder what they are using the data for . they have chips in their combine uniforms too . that is always interesting to see the measurements of speed and agility .
probably to make better plays and improve performance by better understanding player movements and velocity , rotation , and speed of the ball
the science of sport is becomign really sophistocated with analytics and the amount and quality of measurement .
true , but at the same time , some not so scientific rules continue to persist . for instance , new orlean saint ' s cheerleader are forbidden from eating in the same restaurant with any nfl players .
there ' s that nfl sexism ! at least there is no sexism or glass ceiling in the brady house . his wife makes double what he makes . . . .

i ' ve heard that before ! it is so shocking to think that the man who invented the game could not win at it !
he started a game that has evolved tremendously . i doubt he made any money like people do today .
he probably didn ' t . i imagine no one has had a contract like player allen iverson . he got a contract with reebok to make $ 800 , 000 per year until he turns 55 and then a final payment of $ 32 , 000 , 000 .
i guess he must be worth that much to the brand . kids buy the kicks and reebok gets rich . with that money , he could buy part of a team .
i bet he could . it ' s great advertising to be a part of basketball . just look at nike . the nba banned air jordan shoes but michael jordan wore them anyway and nike payed a fine per game . now those shoes are super expensive and super popular .","fines create controversy , which generates interest and revenue . smart business by nike ."

i believe he was . there hasn ' t been a us president who wasn ' t a republican or a democrat since 1853 .
those two parties do have a firm hold . nowadays we talk about red and blue states for the two parties . i can never keep it straight . i think red is a nicer , stronger color but politically i ' m pretty blue .
nice . did you know that consistent use of red and blue colors only started in 2000 ? i could have swore i saw it a lot before then .
i guess that i ' m just a slow learner . i wonder how far back the elephant and donkey as mascots goes . i know in the ' 50s when truman went to disney land he made sure there was no dumbo in the background of any photos .
that ' s a funny story ! before trump , the last time a republican was elected president without a nixon or bush on the ticket was 1928 !
but they take the record for only president to resign , nixon . in the 1930 ' s the northeast and midwest were republican strongholds . now the northeast is a lot of democrats and the south has gone republican .
lol true ! every us president with a beard has been a republican . i never noticed that .
i guess those old guys like washington didn ' t like beards . i won ' t comment on our current guy ' s hair . i ' m sure it ' s unique in some way . but who knows what ' s next in hair , supposedly we lost our body hair about 240 , 000 years ago . what ' s next ?",lol that ' s funny ! humans are adapted for persistence hunting making them among the best distance runners among all running animals .

it is just a sport where so much goes into those 11 minutes from planning to split reactions . i
oh okay . do you know that green bay packers are the only not for profit major franchise in american professional sports ?
they sure have a very old history originating in 1919 and was originally sponsored by the indian packing company
it ' s amazing that they have sold out every game since 1960 .
i hear they are very inclusive with the community and have a big part in the community ' s history and pride so it is no surprise that they have such dedicated fans . they must have been disappointed when the green bay packers lost to the beloit fairies
probably but they are not going to stop being loyal to the team . beloit fairies was the first team to beat the green bay packers .
i think that green bay packers are here to stay as depicted by george martin . if there is every a end of real sports due to simulations , the green bay packers would be the last to go
you are probably right . being a team that is owned and loved by their community is something really special and unusual .
also they are progressive and don ' t have dated rules like forbidding cheerleaders from being in the same restaurant as other nfl players and forcing them to leave even if they came first like the new orleans saints",i ' ve got to run now . i learned a lot from you about the nfl and football . it was nice chatting with you .

Or when Kendra's new phone flickers and she hears a three-note sound that she follows to the basement.
The pace of the movie was really fast in a good way but the only problem was the build up and that it lacked the feelings between the family.

There were some clowns in a box which were sort of creepy. and also some edge-of- your seat moments.

My favorite character was Al Pacino's character, Sonny.
I love Pacino, and this movie is part of the reason why.
Me too, Pacino's performance is exceedingly excellent, manic and energetic.

That's because by the time Sidney Lumet's ""Dog Day Afternoon"" came around he had already learned to let Al Pacino loose.
And my goodness, I didn't know this was a true story, so I was confused when Pacino kept asking for his wife.

Yeah skateboarding is an action packed sport that does involve performing lots of tricks using the skateboard. I am sure if you practice you will get better.
You're right I do need to practice.  I use my skateboard mostly to commute to class right now.
That is one of the uses for a skateboard. A lot of people use it for commuting but also people use it as an art form or even use it in their jobs. But mostly people use a skateboard recreationally.
Yeah.  I see a lot of people riding skateboards around my campus.  I see a lot of falling.
That is definitely a down fall. Pun intended, lol. They say that there are 11.08 million active skateboarders in the world. That is incredible!
Haha. That's a ton of skateboarders.  I had no idea there were that many.
Yeah and the skateboarding market is worth around 4.8 billion dollars in annual sales.
Wow that's a lot of skateboard money.  I'm not familiar with a lot of brands.  Only Tony Hawk.",The most incredible thing is that skateboarding will be represented in Olympic Games in 2020 for the very first time ever.
HOLLED-007026,"Which was the best scene in the movie according to you?
I like the one in which the crocodile bites off Zolo's hand
Scary scene. But this movie is in my top 10 of American action-adventure romantic comedy film.
""Romancing the Stone"" is argubly my favorite adventure movie of all-time. Yep, in my opinion it surpasses all three movies in the ""Indiana Jones"" trilogy (which are right behind in terms of greatness).
Not my favorite but indeed the movie has all it takes to win an Oscar even the supporting characters were great.
Amazing supporting characters in the film. There's Gloria (Holland Taylor from TV's ""The Practice""), Ms. Wilder's publisher; Elaine (Mary Ellen Trainor), Ms. Wilder's sister; and Juan (Alfonso Arau), a Colombian native who actually turns out to be a huge fan of Ms. Wilder.
I so much enjoyed the Juan character, he was full of fun.
That's true, In one very funny scene, Ms. Wilder and Mr. Colton go to the house of this man and ask him if they can borrow his car. The Colombian tells them to get lost, until he finds out that the woman is actually Joan Wilder the novelist, and admits that he's one of her biggest fans who has read every one of her books.
Lol, but i really got entertained by the great adventure story. Awesome.",It is a Superb adventure-comedy.

Oh hell yeah, I love bacon! One of my favorite parts of it is just that it can go good with most anything, it's so versatile.
I've learned that it comes out perfect in our air fryer.  What is your fav way to cook it?
Hmm I'll usually cook it in the oven on a foil covered baking sheet and flip it once or twice while it's cooking.
That's a good way too!  I don't like dealing with it splattering on my stovetop.  We eat keto so we go through a lot of bacon.
Oh yeah bacon is great for a keto diet, because like I said before, bacon can be incorporated into so many dishes as the main dish, side dish, or just used as an ingredient to add flavor.
I use it a lot to wrap chicken breasts in so they are more juicy.  It's probably my 2nd favorite meat after steak.
That sounds delicious! Do you just go with normal bacon? There's so many different types of bacon nowadays, like turkey, beef, and even goat.
I do not like turkey bacon.  It's like rubber.  Give me the good ole pig kind!","Turkey bacon is okay in my opinion, but it's not really a substitute for real bacon in my eyes, since it's so much different."

I thought my man Chie
f Martin Brody was sweet in it. I agree, a shark gots to eat too
I think Robert Shaw was iconic in that movie as  the shark hunter.

He definitely made a great movie, like a Woody Allen movie but with more pizazz!
Exactly! It got pretty good scores on Rotten Tomatoes. I bet it would have got a 99% if it had more pie.

CMUDOG-000791,"Oh, absolutely, he did an amazing job portraying Batman/Wayne's damaged psyche
The cast of Batman Begins was really good.  Michael Caine as Alfred was a great choice also.  His British mannerism sold it on the whole comic scene.
Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman together in a Batman movie is really something special, too
You do not see Katie Holmes as much but is a shining star in her role. I like when they start from the beginning as give the back story and re-build the characters.
I think my favorite thing about the movie, other than the casting, is that it has Ra's al Ghul in it. Scarecrow was pretty great, as well
There always needs to be a good vilian. villian.
I'm glad they focused so much on Bruce's bat phobia. The well scene was top-notch
Liam Neeson almost looks like the Ra's al Ghul comic character.  He also has kind of a dark side. The bat phobia totally goes with building the back story and character.
Gary Oldman definitely looks like Gordon.

When the witch finds that the Ruby Slippers can't be taken against Dorothy's will as long as the girl is alive, she turns her hourglass and threatens that Dorothy will die when it runs out.
So Dorothy could just give them up and live, but she doesn't.
That was the genius of the screenplay, that and to establish the Oz characters as characters that Dorothy meets in Kansas.
She must become so attached to them because they all remind her of someone from the real world.
But also, the three friends that she meets along the way, The Scarecrow, The Tin Man and The Lion are emblematic of the lessons of bravery, love and devotion and the ability to think for ourselves.",I've never met anyone who doesn't love this movie and its characters.

speaking of fish , did you know there was an immortal jellyfish ?
i heard that but wonder how they determined it ?
yeah , i guess there is no way to prove it . a lot easier to prove a seahorse has a neck
yes . maybe the jellyfish in question regenerates itself constantly so they just infer that it ' s immortal .
another surprising fact is the burning of books by the fda , i thought the us was against censorship

Yes but i want to convey that because of differences in legislation between states, the exact definition of a city council can vary that is why it can be so hard to understand sometimes.
Ok, and could you tell me more about the  different kinds city councils?
Okay so basically a city council has different names like town council, town board, or board of aldermen. It is is a legislative body that governs either a city/town/municipality, or a general local governement area. What theyre called in a specific state or what area they govern is the part that varies.
Interesting, and are city councils elected or designated by someone?
I'm not sure ill search for that answer really quickly but i can tell you when looking for a city council in your area you can find it by the title and usually the official title will be ""Corporation of the city of [enter  your city]"" or something similar!
Great  to know!  What else should I know about city councils?
A rural local governement can actually take an urban area and put them under their jurisdiction. I think that is interesting because urban and rural areas have different needs when you think about it. Ihope it works out for those places though
Yes I  hope that too.  My city Council seems to be doing a good job, I live in an urban area.  What about you?",Yes but there are preiodic realignments of boundaries to alleiviate that problem and adjust the deployment of assets/resources to where they need to be.

CMUDOG-003069,"Really? The instructions stated we were not to talk about things we knew from personal knowledge, but from the information in their paragraph. There isn't much information here actually! LOL
No there isn't!!! And I just noticed that Tina Fey's name is at the bottom, duh. Soooooo I guess my next question is do you agree with the rating? I feel like I mostly do, it surprised me for the genre
It's not a genre I'm really into. If I watch a teen movie it's probably one where they are being chased by a giant prehistoric alligator.
HAHA I like horror too even though that'
s way off topic and action and a little comedy and family because I have a small child! Back on topic, lol, have you heard of the director or do you have an opinion of him?
His name doesn't ring a bell with me at all. The critics sure seemed to love it though. What a culture shock it would be to go from homeschooling in Africa to a suburban public high school.
It REALLY would be, they made that part pretty realistic I feel! How about the book? Have you ever heard of or read it? I have heard of it and thought about getting it because I'm a big reader - but I ended up not picking it up yet
I haven't read it although if it came up available free somehow I would. I'll read anything. I wonder how it went from a serious self help book to a comedy? I mean, who got that spark?
LOL I have no idea, I feel like it was partly to get the seriousness of bullying out there but turning it into a comedy kind of shot that out unfortunately
Well when something happens in your life you always get to choose to laugh about it or cry about it. Myself, I always think it's better to find a way to laugh it off if you can. I would imagine it's really theraputic if you were a victim of that kind of thing to be able to look back and see how ridiculous it all really was and move on.
I agree, I really fight for people who get bullied but I also want people to pick themselves up and empower themselves as I do that myself. I see the next topic has arrived! Have you ever had that serious of a situation like this happen at your school? I don't think I've ever seen someone copy and throw papers all over the hallways but ... still lol. And we just talked about the culture shock. I feel like Cady learned a lesson to be with people who accept her instead of running for popularity","I also believe karma works. So, when Regina gets hurt - that's karma. We don't always see it so clearly and obviously, of course. I don't really know if anything like that happened at my high school. By that point I was so thoroughly and completely ostracized they could have burnt the school down and I wouldn't have known a thing about it until I arrived for class the next day. I had a different kind of childhood with a lot of real life drama such as my step-father's lengthy illness and death, my mother running a business in the 1960s and trying to ""cover"" it as his business (it was originally) because a woman, of course, can't run a business!"

Jonah Hill as Donnie Azoff was great also. Jordan Belfort lived such a crazy life as a stockbroker!
Yes, I'd never seen him in a movie before. Yeah, it's scary to think that people get so rich from being stock brokers.
Also, Margot Robbie in this movie was fantastic. Her character was so good. Yes, I agree. The life they lived was so insane.
I guess it's not unlike real life in NYC. I wonder how the real person felt after seeing the movie about him.
Yeah very true. NYC is like that. So do I. I wonder if he learned his lesson.
I haven't been to NYC, just the state. I need to see what all the craziness is about!
I loved the scene with Matthew McConaughey in the beginning of the movie. He was so funny.

My favourite character was Mike which was played by Billy Crystal in the movie.
Excellent.  My favorite character was the Sulley.  He was played by John Goodman.
Brilliant, it was the prequel film to the 2001 movie Monsters, Inc and was the 14th feature film made by Pixar.
It's funny how the Metacrite Score is lower than the Rotten Tomatoes percentage. Did you find it ironic?
That is a bit unsual, different style of reviews I guess.  Some of the comments where great from the critiques, cute, funny, and the animation was colourful.
It's definitely good movie for the kids, since according to one Critical Response, it's ""safe, predictable and edge-fee"".

How much do you know about the Jupiter Mission, Major?
The Jupiter is fully automated. The pilot flies the ship out of the solar system and lands on Alpha Prime. It's a baby sitting job, sir.
Major, you are aware Earth's resources are severely limited.
Every schoolchild knows our recycling technologies will save the environment. Sending a family across the galaxy is a publicity stunt to sell soda to people of all ages.
What I am about to tell you is classified. Every schoolchild has been lied to. The recycling technologies have failed. In less than two decades Earth will be unable to support human life.
We spun the ad campaign to give the mission a friendly face, keep people from panicking in the streets. We partnered with Coke because the 900 billion this mission cost would have bankrupted the government. The SinoJordanian Alliance knows the truth as well as we do. They hope to reach Alpha Prime first - And if they do, I guarantee you, they will not share the Dimondium with Western Demons like us. our crops will wither. We will be left to die.

CMUDOG-003976,"I love Marvel movies. They never cease to amaze me. I haven't seen this movie personally but my son loves it. Have you seen it?
Yeah I saw it when it was first released, it was a great movie. It felt less serious and much more fun than other superhero movies.
I find it interesting that critics say Terrence Howard's character plays a man who looks dispirited and taken for granted. Normally he plays the tough guy in movies. Do you believe the fact that he is slightly depressed and taken for granted can be a direct subliminal message as to how our military solider/veterans are normally treated in today's society?
Yeah compared to his newer roles this was definitely one of the more unique ones in the sense that he was taken for granted. I think what you're saying about the possible hidden messages behind his character could definitely be true as the film has a lot of characters like that such as Shaun Toub. I agree with the critics that Gwyneth Paltrow's performance couldn't really be expressed due to her role and the lack of expansion to her character.
Exactly, judging from the document, it kind of feels like Shaun's played a very important factor in creating the first Iron man suit, but he is not given recognition as one of the inventors. In fact I think he created the most important part of the sure. Without the electromagnet he created, Start would probably be dead. In this sense I would say that actually makes him the hero in the story. Normally that is how it is with her being a supporting character. There are only a few instances where the love interest in the story get's the attention she deserves.
I agree that especially during the time it was released the CGI was amazing and had a very noticeable attention to detail during the action sequences when it was truly shown off.
On another note, I would definitely agree with the critics in regards to it seeming like a military thriller. Normally those types of moves give you a sense of American pride or are extreme tear jerkers. So i can definitely see why there is a feel of depressing and going through the motions. I find it interesting that his character is primarily portrayed as a war hero. Although he is a mythical character, I think the director does a great job with releasing this movie in 2008, shortly after the war ended in Afghanistan in real life. This makes the viewer connect to the story line in more present day realistic struggles/issues. Interesting
I could totally see and agree with the statement it acts as a military thriller in the first half, especially during the key scene where when he is testing a new type of missile from his company in Afghanistan his convoy is ambushed and he is taken captive by a group of terrorists.
In your opinion was Robert Downey Jr a great fit to play this role?
His performance of a wild and egotistical playboy was very spot on and amazing to watch play out on the screen, out of all the performances he definitely is the most memorable of all of them. His performance made me feel like his character would realistically approach problems with the solutions they actually provided on the screen, and that he reacts to people and events in a way that you'd imagine Tony Stark to react.",That's interesting. Looking at the ratings. I would definitely go see this movie. Rotten Tomato critics are tough and this movie has a 94% average. Definitely seems to be a must see.

It's got great ratings 7.9/10. Seems like it's worth watching.
I agree completely, it definitely seems as though this movie accurately depicts many things in that time period and helps us understand the history and reasoning behind it instead of displaying it for entertainment

HOLLED-006734,"What do you think about the characters in this movie?
My favorite character was Andie.
Would you mind if I asked you why? To be honest, I didn't really like the movie that much, and saw no real storyline and definitely no character development whatsoever, so what would make you like one of the characters more than the other?
The dancing. Their dancing was freaking SICK. I've seen a lot, and some of this freestyle was off the charts incredible!
I guess I could see that going to see this movie if you're into dancing, but shouldn't the movie be about more than that?
Come on, dancing makes the movie!
Might be, it is called Step Up after all. Did you like the story or the characters or the dialogue at all, though? Cause otherwise, you could just watch dance videos, right?
I mean, though the plot is weak, and the dialogue laughable, the dancing is enough to make spending your $8 on the ticket more than worth it.
Okay, so give me a dance scene you really liked?","All the ones after Chase comes to her rescue, saying that under the raddar in MSA there are a lot of people who would be skilled enough to join a crew. It turns into art.""HITId"
HOLLED-003137,"Which scene did you like the most in the movie?
I liked the one in which the psychiatrist returns and explains terminators aren't real while the terminator is running in the background.
I liked that scene too. Though, overall I was pretty disappointed with the film.
So was I. It was good, but not worthy of the Terminator franchise.
Definitely not. I think it had a lot to do with the loss of Director Cameron.
Agreed. The new director does not have the ability to time scenes, events, statement and the narrative anywhere near the brilliant level of Cameron.","No, and the audience definitely noticed."

Oh really? I've recently gotten into American football, but I think you're talking about soccer? Is that right?
Yeah, association football. Sorry, I should have specified! He's someone that started way back in 1994. He had good form all the way throughout, and that led him to get an international call-up in 1998, leading him to get signed for the Serie A defending champions, Juventus.
Oh okay! I couldn't recall the name association football! Thierry Henry sounds like quite an amazing player! Is he still playing?
No.. in fact, he's a French association football coach now! And he was--in both 2003 and 2004, he as the runner-up for FIFA World Player of the Year, so that gives you an idea of his skill. Also won two league titles and three FA Cups. Partly why I like him is I'm part French, and he represented us well at the international level, and is our leading goalscorer, too.
Holy moly! He's very accomplished! I bet he makes for a fantastic coach!","I agree with you.. He was mentored by the great Arsène Wenger, who made him somewhat of a prolific striker (which is someone whose primary mission is to score), and so that set him up to be able to be Arsenal's all-time leading scorer with 228 goals in all the competitions he played in."

I need help with clarifying the rules of a game please
I can help you with that. About which game would you like to know?
Jump rope. What are the rules?
While there are multiple variations of jump rope, the consistent one is that the player (or players) spin the rope in a circle while the jumper jumps over it. The object of the game is to continue jumping without tripping on the rope.
That's helpful. How many people can play?
Jumprope can be played with one person spinning and jumping, or with two people spinning and as many jumpers as can fit between them based on the length of the rope",Ok cool. Is there ever a winner at jump rope?

I'm not sure if I have a favorite moment, but I really enjoyed watching Nick's character development through the movie. What about you, do you have a favorite moment?
Nick's character really did develop. I think my favorite moment is when Judy is assigned to give out tickets and she tickets hundreds of cars.
Yes, I liked that she did the best she could even thought the job sucked and she did a crazy good job. Do you generally like this type of movie?
Yes, I think that movies that provoke thought are great. Talking about our society as a whole is important. Like in key scene number one where they are calling certain animals bad names. It is important to think about what we are saying to others. What about you, d
o you generally like this type of movie?
Yes, I really enjoy animated movies and shows in general. I know that Zootopia was really highly rated by critics, do you usually pay attention to that before watching a movie?
Animated movies and shows are great. I sometimes do pay attention. It depends. If I really want to watch a movie, I will not care too much. However, if I am going in theatres or to pay for a movie, I like researching it. What about you?
Pretty much the same haha. If it's a genre I'm really into then I don't usually care what the ratings are. The animation and music was really good in this one too. I can't really think of any part of it I didn't enjoy.
The only thing is that I thought it did get a little dark at times. It was amazing quality. Did you agree with the Rotten Tomatoes score? I would say it was accurate.
Yeah it did get a little dark, my kids got scared a few times but they are 3 and 5. I think it's a pretty awesome rating, like almost perfect. It got pretty tense after Judy had the press conference.",I could definitely see how they would get scared. It was intense. It really made you care about the characters.

It was as I expected. Purely ridiculously awesome.
The movie was packed with jaw dropping, eye popping action from beginning to end.
Oh yes The drama had a mix of sadness, comedy and seriousness which were all mixed in together so beautifully to give a consistency to keep the viewer starring at the screen and being involved in the movie rather than daydreaming about other things.

What was your favorite quote?
I hate to burst your bubble but you are in charge of only two things, Jack and S**t, and Jack just left town.
What makes this movie great?
is the individualist attitude of Ash. He is great because he has a gun and a chainsaw and nobody else does. He has attitude and basically acts like your everyday average rednecked American, and this stands out in the background of Medieval England. Unlike most time travel movies, he does not try to blend in, nor does he hide his technology.
Was Army of Darkness is labelled as black comedy?
Yes, but I would also put it under the category of satire. What we are laughing at is not just death but also the arrogance of the average American redneck.
When I recently hired it I noticed that they had released a directors cut with a different ending
Usually the director's cut is a little better that the original but I don't know with this one. I did like the original ending where he is back in S-Mart and blows away the witch that attacks him, grabs the girl, says ""hail to the king, Baby,"" and kisses her. It is such a cool image.
What do you think about the effects?","The effects are great and still low key. You can tell which deadites are guys in suits and the black fabric behind the eyes of other skeletons, but that's what gives this film it's cheesy B movie goodness. Seeing ASH fight against all the evil mini ashs is a feat for the eyes as well, even if it does look so fake."

Wow. That is crazy. They were originally commonly made from shellac. They didn't start using polyvinyl until the 1950's.
I was pretty sad in the 80's when CD's kind of took over, and vinyl pretty much left the market in 1991, but have since made a slight come back, thank goodness!
Yes, me as well. But, a 12-inch diameter record could only play less then 5 minutes per side, compared to a CD, which can play for a lot longer.",Very true!

OH! This movie is WONDERFUL, this movie is BEAUTIFUL! I just love it, and not because of my fixation on Mozart, but because it is a beautifully made, completely moving work of art
The title of the movie make you think documentary, like why not just title it Mozart?
Look at the connotative meaning of the name ""Amadeus:"" In Latin it means ""Loved by God."" It's so perfect, so fitting that this should be the title.
Salieri's confession, when he was talking to the priest, I knew something was off with him.
Exactly, when He was reminisces about his youth, particularly about his devotion to God and his love for music and how he pledges to God to remain celibate as a sacrifice if he can somehow devote his life to music. But suggests that the sudden death of his father, who choked to death during a meal, was ""a miracle"" that allowed him to pursue a career in music.","Yes!

Thanks i had no idea .  Anything else that i should know ?
Yes! The standard drum kits are non-pitched, which means that music scoring is different for drums than other musical instruments
Thanks for the information.  I might try to learn to play drums someday it sounds pretty fun
You should try! You can get hybrid or entirely electronic drum kits, which would help reduce noise if you have housemates
What type of drums do you play on ? I think i would buy the electronic drum kit if i did start playing
I like using electronic drums! The placement is similar to a standard drum kit but you can control the noise output so it's convenient!",Oh very interesting . I wonder how long it would take to learn

Yes--he started yelling for a handkerchief--screaming.  He grabbed my face and he rubbed all my lipstick off--he rubbed till I thought I wouldn't have any lips left.  And all the time yelling at me--that thing--the thing I told you he called me.  Then I ran out of the house.

Jesse Eisenberg. It did appear people liked this movie more than Man of Steel, have you watched that?
when it came out. I wasn't a fan. I haven't seen it since.
In my opinion, people don't want a superhero who is perfect like superman is. They want someone flawed and easy to relate to. Who is your favorite movie superhero?
I agree with that. I've always been partial to villains. Loki from Thor is one of the best on screen villains I've seen in a while. But the incredible hulk is probably the best.
Then you must have really enjoyed the most recent Marvel movie, Thor Ragnarok.
oh man, i loved it.They went the route of Guardians of the Galaxy with the humor and I really enjoyed it, but i've seen others that didn't.
The most intense moment in Batman vs Superman was when Superman is about to kill Batman and he confuses him by saying ""save Martha."". If you are okay with crude humor deadpool is probably up you're alley. very antihero
deadpool is one of my favorites! It's very good.
Have you watched the movie Super?","Super? No, it doesn't sound very familiar. Sometimes it is hard for me to see movies because there is only one theater where I live and they make poor decisions as to what to play, in my opinion at least."

 ratings.

So this suit....tell me more. Does it fly? Does it shoot lasers? Does it blow stuff up?
It is mixture of mechanics and seamless CG. It is connected to an electromagnet implanted in Tony Stark's chest.
So, he IS the robot?

The suit is named Iron Man?. Tell me more. I think I like this suit. What else happens in this movie?. Who are the villains?
Tony Stark, in his Iron Man suit, suspects that his business partner Obadiah Stane is trafficking weapons. When he travels to Afghanistan to investigate he is shot at. Obadiah Stane gathers pieces of a prototype Iron Man for nefarious purposes.",Interesting. So does Tony Stark end up fighting this Obadiah Stane?. In his Iron Man Suit?

I also like how the plot sets it up so that Gruber is actually using the hostage situation as a cover to steal $640 million in bearer bonds stored in the building's vault.
Yeah, what a twist. Such a well done film.
I say its the ultimate thrill-ride and still the standard by which I judge an action movie!
Nothing else comes close! It's one of my all time favorites.
Personally, I think ""Die Hard"" is one of the greatest action movies ever, up there close to my favorite action movie of all time, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark.""",Bruce Willis is the man! His performance is jaw dropping!

that is crazy . i am glad that they are continuing with it .
me too , even if i don ' t watch it . i appreciate that people get awards for creating quality movies of all genres , especially dramas . i can ' t watch them nonstop , but i do like the overall idea of drama
that is great credit for them . do you have a favorite drama ?
not really . i ' ve considered watching the show house . hugh laurie gets paid a whopping $ 700 , 000 per episode , so it ' s no wonder he does so well in that role
i love dr . house ! he ' s so funny when he ' s serious .
another actor that i like is jim carrey , though now he won ' t act in movies that don ' t project positivity . that weeds out most dramas
didn ' t he stop acting though ? didn ' t he have a documentary ?","it ' s possible that he did , and i ' m not sure . he could probably still teach it like jon hamm does at his old high school . erin from the office , portrayed by ellie kemper , was one of his students . jim could pass on his legacy"
CMUDOG-000934,"hi. got any movie suggestions?
hello. I do happen to have a great one :). I'd like to recommend Bruce Almighty
i will take your recommendation because i have seen the movie and love jim carry my kid have never seen. It's been a while though would you be interested in telling me a bit about it?
yes it stars Jim Carrey whom I love along with Morgan Freeman and Jennifer Aniston. it's about a reporter that's having a bad time and complains to God so he gets to play God for a week
morgan freeman is one of my absolute favorite actors along with jim carre. Jennifer aniston is a great actor as well. The years have been kind to her..
I love all three of the main actors and actresses too
Didn't they make a sequel to bruce almighty?
do you happen to know why the Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic scores would be so low? They're 48 percent and 46/100 respectively
wow no i wouldn't. i remember all the good critique from the 90s about it i don't know why they would give such a low rating
Evan Baxter is the rival who gets the promotion that causes the breaking point for Jim Carrey's character in the movie",Ah yea that's steve carrell huh?
TPCCHT-000188,"hah , i guess cinematography isn ' t everything . i think we all know how he must have felt getting a late fee . if only everyone were as determined to do something about frustrations !
true . i do like cinematography though . it is amazing what can come from a lens and light .
cinematography is so fascinating . it ' s like an intersection of physics and visual art , because of all the dependence on understanding how light and lenses work .
true , but it is also about technology - how the sensor produces an electrical charge for each pixel .
i can ' t pretend to understand all the technology behind it . it ' s like magic in a way .
ok . i guess ultimately it is about the people behind it , like james wong howe who won an oscar .
do you know what movie he won for ?
i do not know , but he frequently used a crab dolly and deep - focus cinematography to create his style .
i wonder why some people have such a gift for cinematography . they seem to be able to picture things in their minds that make such a visual impact even though others wouldn ' t imagine it beforehand .
very true . stanley kubrick had a vision and took the camera from his cinematographer , but allowed him to keep the credit .","i would be awfully annoyed if i were that cinematographer , haha . first i can ' t do my job , then i get credit for something i didn ' t even do !"

TPCCHT-005456,"i would hope the student player is motivated to stay . education is never a bad thing , unless you ' re young . and you can make millions playing ball . what does condoleezza rice have to do with any of this ?
i don ' t know what condolezza rice has to do with this i do know that people write to her most likely because she has the power to change the rules in the ncaa , but that last part is just speculating . nba allen iverson actually signed a deal with rebook to pay him 800k a year until hes 55 then at the end recieve 32 million in a lump sum ! i guess you could start your own education facility what that kind of money .
i think condi is associated with the fbi . they are the ones revealed findings of corruption . thats a stunning amount of money to pay any one person .
from personal knowledge i believe shes a politician , which does relate her to this . nba is an active member of usab ( usa basketball ) which is also recognized by the fiba ( international basketball federation ) that is a huge amount ! the nba is on the most four major sports and nba players are the worlds best paid atheltes by average salary
i once attended a college basketball game . its funny how the game means so much to some and almost nothing to others . more fun to play with friends than watch . have you ever owned air jordan sneakers ?
thats true that some people really care and some don ' t about basketball . i ' ve always liked jordans , but lately i ' ve been buying them to resell . not a big fan of the nba , but since people are they are willing to wait in line for shoes and create bots online to try to get them . i wouldn ' t be suprised if the shoe companies are a part of the corruption , they are pretty unethical since they use offshore labor !
it seems likely that shoe money leads to corruption . air jordans were banned by the nba . jordan wore them anyway and nike paid the fine . not corruption , but the league was ineffective in rule enforcement .
oh thats interesting did not know they were banned was that a specific type of air jordan or all of them ? maybe they were a specific color , he probably made his fine back by the exposure of the shoe . yeah i believe the ncaa needs to enforce their rules more so the fbi and governing bodies don ' t have to get involved / nba explotiation is not new i guess
i have no idea about the color . nike can probably make any color desired . maybe people like tim duncan could help in some way . he stayed in school for four years instead of going directly to the nba .
so like one time people were getting killed over this specific colorway and thats why they got banned . i could get on really offtopic about jordan . if the nba followed baseball rules are learned from them , they would probably have less issues .","i see . well , if physicists were cool , "" granny style "" would be a thing . talk to you later ."

Yes it definitely does seem like an art project / someone's creative expression.
Do you think they end up together in the end?
I enjoy the fact that it is innovative. It may not be amazing but it's opened doors for development on a new artistic subgenre. Of course, I'm no expert to comment on that, it's just my understanding of it. I think they probably do.
I can appreciate that. Ah twist in scene 3.  Well I guess you have to have them fall apart so they eventually get back together on new terms.  Are there any other romance comedies that you enjoy?
Haha that's a good way to look at it. I'm not a huge fan of romance comedies because they're somewhat demeaning to women sometimes and very basic and predictable. However, I like romantic comedies that are extremely hilarious with actors who are know to be very hilarious though. How about you?. known**
Maybe some from the 80's out of nostalgia.  Yes agreed women are usually used as a prop.  Actually something I can not stand is when the characters fall in love because they are supposed to, but you can't actually see any value in either character or why they would even have a connection.  Sometimes it seems writers are just going through the motions.  But I guess thats why it is a business.
That's a great insight into how the business works. I feel like scene 3 is dramatic in a way that you would see in a school play or a teen movie / disney movie. It doesn't represent real life relationship drama as well as something like Silver Linings Playbook. However there are still some interesting points they're touching on that could be applicable to many relationships. It's just cheesy with the whole band thing.
Haha agreed!  Yes band thing definitely makes it cheesy. I've never heard of John Legend of Callie Hernandez.  Have you?. *of Callie. Shoot I meant Or.
Yes John Legend is actually quite a unique artist in my opinion. You may have heard some of his songs at events / on the radio. He's an African American pianist with a unique voice. His music moves me and it's classical but modern at the same time. He's married to the model Chrissy Teigen, not sure if you follow that kind of stuff haha. I think he's won Grammy's.

that is interesting and i do believe that . i support trump but i don ' t agree with everything . then again he is not a politician but a businessman and i think that is the difference that people can ' t quite put together .
presidents certainly seem to place their personal beliefs in office and aren ' t able to separate them . i know roosevelt banned christmas trees because he was a conservationist .
well they are like everybody else they have their own thoughts on things and i think they should be able to express those thoughts to a certain degree .
that ' s definitely fair . however they should pay the same diligence to important things as well . it somehow took the white house 4 days to realize bullets had hit them on 9 / 11 .
i know , pretty unbelievable , but it seems now nobody is required to do their jobs to get paid . i see it everyday . it ' s a general decline in society that has been unchecked for some time . just my take on it .
that certainly seems true sometimes . at least they can be socially responsible at times , i know george w . bush put solar panels back on the white house .

well i think the universe is very interesting . i like the different theories people have about it . one theory is that the whole universe is a giant hologram , what do you think ?
i think that theory is crazy but i guess anything is possible even the theory of a single electron in the universe
don ' t know how that theory works . but i do know that elon musk is really smart and he believes in the hologram theory lol . i also want to find a star that i can touch with my hand that would be cool
that would be cool , i would like to take a selfie holding that star lol , and elon musk is really smart so that gives that theory points
yep that ' s what i ' m thinking haha . i ' ll leave it to the smart people to decide . another cool idea is that universe is evolve through natural selection , just like how animals did . that ' s pretty cool to think about
it is a pretty cool theory , it makes sense if we evolve that way i guess its a legit hypothesis ,

no , 212 ? cant recall it , maybe its the area code for miami ?

I used to stay up late myself as well a few years ago, but not anymore. Not since I heard about the drawbacks of staying up late.

Well, I don't go to sleep too early. I don't think. Usually at about 11:30 PM. Where does that fall on the spectrum? Shouldn't be too late/early, right?
I'm not sure exactly where you would fall. But, a night owl usually stays awake past midnight. And extreme night owls may stay up before or after dawn.
Ah, then I'm just a little short of being a night owl. How early does a typical early bird rise? I would like to compare it to my own rising hours.","I'm not sure on the time for early birds. But, they are often called A-People and night owls are often called B-people, especially in Scandinavia."

Whether and, and I think that, and I know Massachusetts has, a bottle bill was passed and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now, and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably, believe it or not, is just to get the extra nickel at the, uh, the store and not, uh, that's the majority of people that I know of anyways.

I see no wonder I hate rollercoasters since I am claustrophobic as well. Do you know if there is any treatment for this fear?

The Social Network easily rivals Fincher's previous works like ""Fight Club"" or ""Se7en"".
Did the film have any weaknesses, critically speaking?
Not really, it has a very perversely attractive appeal, a glimmering awfulness, as it was lit from within.

HOLLED-002190,"What do you think about the characters in this movie?
My favorite character was Michael Sullivan Jr, that kid actor had a lot of guts to play the role he did, and not be screwed up for life because of that one role.
I think he did a great job as well! What did you think about the adult actors?
Every actor here is deserving of acclaim and Academy attention, mainly Jude Law.
Jude Law was certainly a highlight, though I've heard people say that there was a lack of emoting through the whole movie.
Nonsense, any emotional detachment is intentional; It is a tragic story, one of betrayal, love, bonds, and revenge. There is no doubt this film will become a classic.
I could see that with the start studded cast list, but what about the rest of the production?
Thomas Newman absolutely knocked it out of the park with the score! Really beautiful film.
The score was great, the directing was good, but some of the writing was a little stilted.
I agree, Loved the movie except for one thing. The whole build-up led to an ending they changed for some unknown reason. Could have been much better.",I think they could have stuck to the original plot and it would have been great.

WOWIKI-019497,"Do you ever enjoy listening to gospel music?
I listen to a bit of Christian music, but I don't really like the genre of Gospel music. I prefer Christian music with a more popular genre.
I like that too. For me, even though I was not raised in an African American church tradition, I still enjoy the sound of gospel as a departure from what I grew up with.
I prefer R&B style. Funny enough, gospel music is one of the roots of R&B music. I guess I like the combination.
Do you have a favorite R&B artist?
I think my favorite would have to be Toni Braxton. I love her voice, her style, and most of her songs.",I have heard of her but don't know many of her songs.  I will check her out! Has she put out any albums recently?

I do.  I think it would be interesting to visit the Mount Adams stratovolcano and follow some of the routes the Native American tribes took.
That sounds cool, is it lava and magma still active?
While it hasn't erupted in over a thousand years, experts do not classify it as being extinct.
Oooh sounds dangerous then, my kind of hiking adventure
If that sounds like your kind of adventure, then you'd love the Ring of Fire.  It has 452 vlocanoes!  When you tally it up, it's more than 75% of Earth's active and dormant volcanoes.

they had an offer to buy netflix for $ 50 million and now it is worth $ 2 billion !
boy , i wish i had bought that stock ! i would be rich ! lol how much debt does netflix have now though ?
i am not sure . but i think it is funny the creator was tired of late fees for vhs and created netflix .
yeah , anger is a good motivator . he built a company that gave people exactly what they wanted . convenience and no late fees .
that is how most companies should be started by finding a problem and offering a solution that everyone loves .
yeah , it takes some passion and drive to build something like netflix , i suspect . i dont think that i could do it . netflix spends 20 times more on postage than bandwidth . i wonder where those customers are .",i did not know some people still received movies through postage .

I liked the last talk with Kevil and Marley. the groceries part was cool too, imo. *Kevin
and ofocurse pretty funny when the 2 guys tried to go into the house. and they get their butts kicked

I liked the one in which Magneto said literally anything
I love Ian McKellen.
Hugh Jackman was the best part of the series, but they have completely sidelined all the good characters.
It was awful especially the disregard for the previous films.
It was rushed storytelling. And very bad plotting.","It was very bad, it could have been so amazing but they ruined it by rushing the filming and production."

HOLLED-004961,"What is your opinion about the movie?
I think it was pretty good.
That scene where Ed first interviews Bill was so creepy, I really didn't notice that the figure had changed behind him
My entire audience gasped when Ed and Lorraine were talking at breakfast and the daughter walked in because we all thought she was a apparition.
Yeah, The Conjuring 2 doesn't waste time in bringing the scares in.
Did you like the part when It growls as it runs toward Lorraine, causing her to see the same vision as before, only this time, we see the man who dies - it's Ed, simply saying, ""I'm sorry, Lorraine"" before a large wooden spike impales him?
Yeah, when they ran out of the house after the dresser moved, the entire theatre busted out in applause

CMUDOG-001634,"Hi! Have you ever seen the movie Jaws?
Hello. No unfortunately I haven't seen this movie. Have you?. It looks like it could be a cool gore/action type of film, what do you think?
Yes I have. I originally
 saw it was I was twelve. It was very scary back then. Not so much now. It does not compare to the gore movies of today. I can believe you have not seen Jaws. Wow. How old are you?
Yeah I know what you mean, I was rewatching the movie ""Carrie"" the other day that seemed scary when I first saw it around the age of 7. But now in my 30's it's just not as scary or interesting.
I know what you mean. I am in my fifties. When I saw the Jaws the first time it was the scariest movie have had ever seen. Now it is sort of funny with the fake shark.
I am 40. I saw quite a few movies but Jaws was one that somehow slipped through the cracks. I've been to the Universal Studios ""Jaws"" set drive through that was kind of cool though. Have you ever been there. Yeah by today's standards seems like it could be kind of a campy film. Yeah I love the modern comedy movie's that spoof alot of other films!
No I have not. Funny after I saw it, I wanted to be a marine biologist for a while. I lived in New England.
HaHa,
 yeah one thing I can say about alot of the 1980's films is they were creative and original, rather than all these sequels trilogies and remakes going on now.
Have you ever seen any of scenes of the movies. I was really popular. The first scene with the girl swimming was awesome. We used to redo the scene when we were kids in the pool. Her being pulled under by the shark. Then of course, people would try to scare you at the beach by sneaking up under you while you were in the water. Do you live where there are lots of beaches?","Yeah the theatrical trailors made it seem kind of compelling like who was going to make it out alive. I definitely remember the theme beat of the shark movement ""dun dun dun dun"" type of thing. What do you think of this critical response where it says ""not once do we feel particular sympathy for any of the shark's victims"" was that true were the characters kind of flat in the movie?"

HOLLED-006229,"What do you think about the characters in this movie?
My favorite character was Octavio.
I think there is a character in 'Amores perros' who looks like Karl Marx. He is a tramp and an assassin, a good bourgeois who one day, Reggie Perrin-like, abandoned his family, and, un-Reggie Perrin-like, joined the Sandanistas in an effort to create a better world.
And then earning 20 years in prison for his troubles.
Walking the streets with a creaky cart and a gaggle of mangy dogs, he was found by the policeman who jailed him, who gave him a dingy place to live, food, and the odd, non-official contract.","Indeed El Chivo is the soul of the film, the missing link, both in appearance (a man called 'The Goat', who has rejected the civilities of society and lives a beast-like existence with his dogs, amongst the ruins of civilisation), and narrative function."

HOLLED-002729,"What is your opinion about the movie?
Development for the film started as far back as 1990.
Wow. That might explain how it came to be nominated for so many awards.
Right. The film did win for the Kid's Choice Awards, besides receiving USA Favorite Female Movie Star, for 2008 and The Golden Trailer Awards Best Teaser Poster.
So the kids really enjoyed it. However, I have to wonder how the die-hard comic book followers felt about it, especially given that the movie versions usually change the backstory.
Right. The audience doesn't even get Gallactus as a defined character, just some sissy-ass cloud character. Whereas, he's a huge backstory in the comic book version of Silver Surfer.
Unfortunately, it wasn't just the storyline that lacked, the dialogue was totally lackluster, even when put into the mouths of an amazing cast.
I really hope this movie doesn't kill the careers of the cast, as they are the only good thing about this movie.","Well, the cast is a saving grace. But so is the opportunity to see London's newest architectural icon."

i think it was an awesome movie I have been a big fan of transformers when since I was a kid and the action was non stop.
I thought it had some good laughs too like when Ironhide lands in a swimming pool; and a little girl who sees him asks if he's the tooth fairy.
The whole aliens shooting through the sky thing reminded me of Independence Day, I liked that one too.
Yeah and just like Independence Day this is in no way a kids movie, it's way more for the adults.
This is true adults who grew up with it will like that it kept true to the mythos, even though it was different.
The story line was great but the FX were better and I have to say you haven't seen it all until you've seen it in IMAX.

It is guaranteed that you will be either jumping or cringing in your seat half the time, unless you are one of those people lacking heavily in the department of sensitivity and/or general thought processing.
It is the most intense American supernatural horror comedy film.
Wow i cannot just explain the intensity of the horror I experienced especially where all the lights go out and Christine is left alone in the dark. Her gate starts creaking and she sees a silhouette of a goat's head on the wall which then throws her into the cabinets causing minor injuries.
But surprisinly despite the so much horror it was still funny.

yes i do like rock music ! i especially like that a lot of rock artists seem to be down to earth , like even after becoming the biggest rock star in russian history , viktor tsoi kept his job in the boiler room .
that ' s too funny . did you know that the state rock song of oklahoma is "" do you realize ? "" by the flaming lips ?
i didn ' t know states could have state rock songs ! i wonder if illinois ' is that song that became the most requested track on that chicago alt - rock radio station .
that could be . you mean that hanson song ? yes , the dj didn ' t reveal who sang the song or what band did and so everyone wanted to hear who did it , probably .
yes that ' s the one ! i think it ' s interesting that no one knew the band / its members . on the other hand you have bands like whitesnake , which has had over 50 members throughout it ' s history .
whitesnake was one of my favorite bands . i didn ' t know that they had so many members that they had their own wikipedia page about it though . funny .
i also saw recently on wikipedia that sonic the hedgehog was actually supposed to be a member of a rockband , with a blond human girlfriend named madonna !
right , very funny . i heard that one , too . rock music is actually very interesting , it typically has a 4 / 4 time signiture using a verse - chorus form but it has become extremely diverse . like pop music , lyrics often stress romantic love but also address a wide variety of other themes that are frequently social or even political .

Even though this was made by James Cameron, the same director who gave us ""Aliens"", both movies are very hard to compare.
What I liked so much about this movie was that this time the aliens didn't feel threatening at all.
It was something completely different from what we were used to see and it worked perfectly.

Fish launch themselves in the air and hit you and you're going very very fast through rocky rapids. The Inuit people were gutsy, they're who invented it thousands of years ago.
Damn they must've been to have to deal with all that! What did they invent it for? Recreation, travel, or what?

hi ! yes , i love netflix . in fact , i ' m proud to say i ' m one of the reasons netflix accounts for 33 % of all the north american bandwidth from 9pm to 12am . how about you ?
i used to be part of that bandwidth too . i dont use netflix now . it takes up too much of my time .
lucky you ! ha ! i ' m addicted to both youtube and netflix and again , i ' m one of the reasons they both account for half the peak internet traffic in north america . ha !
yeah , the bandwidth usage is just going to go up . people want that video entertainment .
indeed ! but it ' s crazy that netflix actually spends 20 times more on postage than on bandwidth ! i find that hard to believe !
i guess some people dont live in areas with enough bandwidth . they need the post .
yeah that could be why . but just think where we ' d be today if blockbuster hadn ' t rejected an offer to buy netflix for $ 50 million . that was a huge mistake on their part considering netflix is now worth $ 2 billion .
yeah , i would have made the same mistake . i would not have expected netflix to become netflix .
i don ' t think i would have either . we all have reed hastings to thank for letting a late fee on a vhs copy of apollo 13 accumulate to $ 40 , inspiring him to create netflix !","yes , netflix did not charge late fees and people loved it . it worked out great , but not for bb ."

Interesting... I don't know the meaning of offal, I guess. Could you give me a brief definition?
Sure, offal simply refers to the internal organs and etrains of a butchered animal. It's also known as variety meats or organ meats too.

Tea is also very popular around the world - right after water.
I know shrimp are expensive so they must be getting harder to catch
It's a shame too, because it just means that that much more bycatch will be caught up in those massive shrimp trawlers, such as dolphins.
I know the casinos advertise huge seafood buffets at cheap prices so I suspect they buy a lot of shrimp and prawns","Being that Indonesia has one of the most vibrant cuisines in the world, I wouldn't be surprised if their casino buffets were loaded with prawns and shrimp."

CMUDOG-002958,"i liked the movie a lot as well. i consider 70% pretty good since rotten is pretty harsh on criticism for movies. it was very funny and fresh
I'm surprised by the critical response claustrophobia in scope,  I felt the movie explored a wide range of topics
oh the critical response is horrible. none of the characters were even dull to begin with
I agree
the ""irresponsible glorification"" was what made the movie funny
Yes I agree, the movie was funny because of this. I feel like the movie was somewhat realistic
oh totally. the scene where jordan learns that a stockbroker's only job is to make money for himself is what started his whole binge. its like he matched his talent with the system by exploiting it
I think the movie was very believable because of this, the main character was poised to get involved in a money making scheme. Do you recognize all actors listed in the document ?
yea basically everybody. jordans pump and dump scheme was very savvy
I feel like the scheme could have went on longer if he didn't alert the FBI",thats cuz he made 22 mil in 3 hours. smh

france is my favorite team and did you know that they won the title in 1998 and won second place in 2006 which is 8 years later . thats great
nice . i like new zealand - they went undefeated in 2010 . .
they are good too . i am italian so i like to root for italy but france wins alot more . they are the current champ having won a tournament in russia in 2018",i lived in venice in college ! italy is a great country ! i am not sure they are as tech savvy as japan though - projecting 3d holograms of the games live onto fields all over teh world

CMUDOG-001418,"Hi, Yes I do. Zootopia happens to be one of them. How about you?
yes, I love everything that has to do with disney, zootopia is my favorite. Did you imagine Jason Bateman doing a character like these?
Not at all! I thought he only did live-movies and not animated ones. 
Did you know that Ginnifer Goodwin played the character of Officer Judy Hopps? I didn't know about it until today. I thought Officer Hopps was played by someone else. It's also interesting that Idris Elba played Chief Bogo in this movie.
Like I did not know this, but then you understand why these characters were so well developed, thanks to these great actors. Which was your favorite scene?
Me neither! I had no idea A-listers played for Zootopia! My favorite scene from the movie was when they found out that Dawn Bellwether, the assistant mayor, was the culprit in all of the missing animals and when Officer Hopps and Nick were able to catch her using Hopps' recording pen. What about you? What's your favorite scene from the movie?
my favorite scene is when Mr. Big appears with his bodyguards ... it's the funniest thing in the whole movie
That's interesting! Did you think that Nick was culprit from the beginning of the movie?
the truth is that at the beginning it looked something malicious, but not really, if he suspected that it would be the one that one least would imagine. Did you watch this movie because of its critical ratings or why?
I didn't suspect him at all actually. I thought it was the mayor who was involved with the missing animals. No, I watched the movie right as it came out of the theaters
Did not the animals scare you when they were wild?",Not at all. I thought it was pretty cool! What about you?

MOVDIC-064490,"No. Though I have no way to prove otherwise. The virus is extraterrestrial. We know very little about it, except that it is the original inhabitant of this planet.
A virus?
A simple, unstoppable lifeform. What is a virus but a colonizing force that cannot be defeated? Living in a cave, underground, until it mutates. And attacks.
This is what you've been conspiring to conceal? A disease?
No! For God sake you've got it all backwards.
Aids, the ebola virus -- on the evolutionary scale they are newborns. This virus walked the planet long before the dinosaurs.
What do you mean, walked?
Your aliens, Agent Mulder, your little green men, first landed here millions of years ago. Those that didn't leave have been laying dormant underground since the last Ice Age. In the form of an evolved pathogen. Waiting to be reconstituted when the alien race from which it came returns to colonize the planet. Using us as hosts. Against this we have no defense. Nothing but a weak vaccine.  Do you see why it was kept secret? Why even the best men -- men like your father -- could not let the truth be known?
Until Dallas, we believed the virus was simply a controlling organism. That mass infection would make us a slave race.
That's why you bombed the building.","Imagine our surprise when they began to gestate. My group has been working cooperatively with the alien colonists, facilitating their programs. To give us access to the virus. In false hope we might be able to secretly find a cure. So that we might save ourselves, as the last of the species.  Your father wisely refused to believe this, choosing hope over selfishness. Hope is the only future he had: his children,  The only future any of us have."

CMUDOG-003628,"While the message of The Post is very important in this political landscape, I think Speilberg did it a disservice by making it so quickly. I thought the editing was off and they real downplayed the role the NYT had in the Pentagon Papers.
I'd have to completely agree. For me, given our current climate, it feels a bit difficult to see this movie through some sort of unbiased lens given some of the parallels I'm sure we can all see.
Absolutely. It really felt like it was more about timing than painting a riveting portrait of the events. Even the sets felt a little off.
It's unfortunate when a movie like this comes out, it feels like it's trying to touch a nerve with us, like it wants us to see how it relates to us in these times rather than resting its laurels of good story telling.
Absolutely. When you look at something like Good Night and Good Luck, that film was timely sure, but it really wanted to settle into its own rhythm and style. And it takes its time to become enriched in character and mood, which makes the political payoff feel earned.
I completely get where you're coming from there, it didn't feel so much like something that was striking while the iron was hot, it had its own merit. That said, and feel free to disagree, it feels like for events that are so recent, it's hard to immerse yourself in a movie when certain lead stars are so famous. It's hard to not watch this movie and see Tom Hanks as any of his other roles rather than as Ben Bradlee",Absolutely. And Streep as well. The only person I thought that nailed their portrayal was Odenkirk. I would've been much more invested if Bagdikian was the main character.

I liked the one where Han's can explodes

On the streets of Tokyo, speed needs no translation...
What did you think of it?
Here's what I wrote for the article ""I'm getting the feeling that the majority of reviews here as of June 14th are bogus. Why write a review if you've only seen the trailer for the film? Anyway, I had the opportunity to see this movie yesterday. Yeah, this is the one of those film series people will hate before seeing. It's over the top, has cheesy dialogue, and has an unlikeable protagonist. With that said, it's actually pretty entertaining, and isn't all that bad. We are introduced to Sean Boswell (Lucas Black), a high school kid who can't seem to find his niche in life. He's moved from town to town with his divorced mother, and getting into problems with the law, before finding himself in Southern California. The California scenes pay homage to Justin Lin's earlier film, Better Luck Tomorrow, almost feeling like an extension of that film. We see the crowds of students in the courtyard, almost peripheral to a particular point in time. Moving to California doesn't change anything, and Sean, the outsider, finds himself racing Clay (Zachery Ty Bryan, from Home Improvement), a rich kid who has it all, including a brand new Dodge Viper. In trouble with the law yet again, Sean finds himself moving to Japan, for reasons that aren't particularly clear. We don't know exactly why he *had* to move; however, it doesn't really matter anyway. Sean continues to find himself as an outsider. From his distant father, to his language barrier, to being unfamiliar with traditional customs. Unlike other particular American films, the culture of Japan was portrayed in a positive light. This was particularly refreshing, as the food jokes, Engrish jokes, height jokes, etc. have become very tiresome over the years. Sean meets Twinkie (Lil Bow Wow), and Han (Sung Kang), the latter of which appears to be the same character from Better Luck Tomorrow. Both Twinkie and Han serve as guides or mentors to Sean, as he becomes more familiar with Japan, school, drifting, and its associated group. In retrospect, Twinkie seems like an unnecessary character, and quickly gets shelved to Sung Kang's Han, who steals the show like a pimp. Sean also meets, and is attracted to Neela (Nathalie Kelley), who is the girlfriend of DK (Brian Tee). DK is a nickname for ""Drift King."" Sean quickly realizes this as he loses badly to him in his first race in Japan (and smashing up Han's S15 badly). The altercation between Sean and DK heats up leading to the climax of the film. Sean Boswell is an unlikeable character. His mannerism is interesting during the California scenes and you actually do get to like him, however he quickly outwears his welcome. From his unjustified temper, to his grating southern accent, Han becomes more of the likable protagonist. The dialogue was cheesy as hell too (remember the ""I'm free"" line from the first one? This is worse - the moonlight drifting scene is embarrassingly bad). Character development is too hurried at times, much like this review. As with Kill Bill, Sonny Chiba is as charming as ever, this time playing a Yakuza boss, who happens to be the uncle of DK. Now, the racing scenes were actually not that bad. Compared to the outlandish effects of the first two FF films, Tokyo Drift is pretty understated. Racing-wise, this was a vendor-fest. 350Z's (VERY prominently displayed), RX-8's, and an EVO. Other than that, there was an R34 GT-R, S15, and the Veilside RX-7. That's really about it (with the obvious exception of the Mustang). I think I saw a glimpse of an AE86 hatch. Will it make people drift in the parking lot leaving the theatre? Yes. In fact, I saw some guy in a Camry attempting to do so. Will it spark interest in the vendor-sponsored cars? Probably. Will it increase resale value of your S13 or AE86? Probably not. Finally, there are two notable cameos in this film (among others). The first cameo has to do with ""DK"" (not the film character). The second cameo ties the film to its predecessor. Both appearances were pretty well done and drew laughter from the crowd.""
So where did that guy go, when he did that thing? you know that thing he did!
He goes inside to get money that a very large man owes Han. Brian is tossed out the door, and the large man tosses the money to Han. They then proceed to drive down to DK's Yakuza underground casino/storage room. While driving, Han tells Sean that he now works for him. At the casino, Sean demands that DK teach him to drift, to which Han agrees. Once at the compound, Sean and Han head back to where DK, and his second in command, Morimoto, (Leonardo Nam) are playing a game. DK instructs Sean to leave the room while him and Han discuss ""business"", where DK asks where Han's ""shipment"" is. Han tells him not to worry, and him and Sean leave to go to Han's garage. On the way, Han explains that DK is not Yakuza, only his Uncle Kamata is, and that DK and Han are simply working on their turf. Han further explains that he let Sean race because he's DK's ""Kryptonite"".

CMUDOG-000233,"Id still see it despite bad reviews. I generally like to decide things by myself to see if i like it or not. Like if 99% of people say its bad or good. I usually won't follow what i hear. I just go and experience it for myself. And then from there I usually say its cool or 
say its bad.
Makes sense. I typically only pay attention to the ratings when it's a director who I am familiar with. If I know that their work is usually phenomenal and a particular movie has awful ratings, I usually will wait to hear from friends/family before paying to see it.
Also im a fan of comedy movies. So I'll probably enjoy for the memes and jokes. Ya same.
Comedy movies are always a must see in my book.
And if im being honest, pixar usually makes good movies so I have good expectations. Illumination movies is what im ""
iffy"" about.

i think i have seen the movies these people made about the wolf pack . they are really good .
yeah , that ' s very interesting . i have not . for six years in the 1990s , documentary filmmaker jim dutcher lived among a pack of wolves in idaho .
i fully believe that we should leave the wolves and the other animals alone . animal packs and herds do not need to be culled by humans . they have biological ways of doing that themselves .
it ' s weird to think that the way the dutchers see it , these wolves - the sawtooth pack - became their social partners .
too bad humans don ' t seem to be able to accomplish that . we are always fighting with each other . humans do not get along . we are basically killers and that is that .
no doubt , we could learn a lot from others . on another note , did you know that ringo starr , george carlin , and alec baldwin have all narrated thomas the tank engine for at least 52 episodes each ?
wow , they all have really good voices . my son used to watch that show .
yes , they do . my son did as well . i didn ' t realize it .

WOWIKI-008830,"I really enjoyed Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austin. There is such a good message about being open to other people in it and looking beyond class.
Yes, you're right. Elizabeth bennet, the main character, learns the error of making fast judgments of people. You can miss out on really great people by having a bias against them before even speaking to them!
And it is especially true of the hero. He was very biased against her class. This was very typical of the time period, and I think even relevant today.
Were you a fan of the film as well as the book?
Yes, I like both of them. I love romance, and write romance so this is right up my ally! Jane Austen was one of the best romance writers, and it is amazing that she wrote so long ago.
It's quite a shame that her novels didn't bring her much fame while she was alive
